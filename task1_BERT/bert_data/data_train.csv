17,"How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales These droplets land on objects","and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China. It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States.
In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread. https://t.co/ItmFmb8ghD",0

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.","2. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 3. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 4. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 8. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. 9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread? 10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. 13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. 13.(A)
However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: 13.(B)
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 13. (C)
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. 13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.",0

24,"The Coronavirus Outbreak
Answers to your most common questions:
Updated March 2, 2020

What is a coronavirus?
It is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can","and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to lung lesions and pneumonia.
How contagious is the virus?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.Where has the virus spread?
The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 89,700 in at least 67 countries and more than 3,000 have died. The spread has slowed in China, but is picking up speed in Europe and the United States.
What symptoms should I look out for?
Symptoms, which can take between two to 14 days to appear, include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, but people may be able to pass on the virus even before they develop symptoms.
How do I keep myself and others safe?
Washing your hands frequently is the most the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you‚Äôre sick and avoiding touching your face.
How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?
Keep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members.
What if I‚Äôm traveling?
The C.D.C. has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea, China, Italy and Iran. And the agency has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan. How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?
Several drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. A vaccine to stop the spread is still at least a year away.",0

29,"MISCONCEPTIONS

¬†1.) COVID-19 is just like the flu/another strain of the flu.

¬†2.) COVID-19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu.

¬†3.) Younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.","all individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) Which brings me to point #4.¬†
¬†4.) The actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction. Of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of COVID-19 in this coming fall. (4) The reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infect The prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in COVID-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of COVID-19 in the fall able to severely affect all individuals as the more COVID-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) The stopping of the spread of COVID-19 now is CRUCIAL to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly, I am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. I highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family, and your community. The efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. The actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come. a result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8)

I would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and I applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases. immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. It should also be noted that not extending the course of the COVID-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace as I urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself.¬†

33,"Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.
There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.","By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. https://t.co/H8M0OgibEU The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. https://t.co/kSdfGWv5GI Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?
No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. https://t.co/sJhxDjdhrA Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?
Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?
No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

They recommend a 2m distance and also they steps and guidelines in disinfecting consultation rooms and test centers @agingqi @DrZweliMkhize I like the idea rather be safe than sorry @DrZweliMkhize Can't you allow the stores to sell us printers and ink as part of the essentials ,we need to print school stuff for our children @DrZweliMkhize To which you add choose items that promote health not sickness. So stop  with the sugar, flour, vegetable oils and rice. @DrZweliMkhize And the most important thing is to wear a mask. Because any customer or cashier could be an asymptomatic carrier. You've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth.

üêæ *Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?*
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.","While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products. üê∂ *Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?*
There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.",0

101,"Myths about the Corona Virus

1. Taking ice cream and other cold foods do not facilitate or aid the onset of the disease.
2. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease.
3. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted via mosquito bites. https://t.co/RBZy4aA12F","4. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 5. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever. 5. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with a fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. 6. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.
7. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. 8. To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.",0

Here is another PK modeling paper of HCQ and my thoughts on it.","@88549439 Actually, long QT risk related to plasma concentration. RECOVERY trial loading regime designed to reach the IC50 for SARS-CoV-2 from in vitro studies rapidly, but chronic HCQ treatment for, say, rheumatoid reaches these concentrations but much more slowly. @88549439 Admittedly, the [HCQ] reached is at upper end of what used for RhA, but within that range. @Prof_Marciniak https://t.co/3HCOs6GYC1 @88549439 Paper not out but last weekend owing to the WHO recommended pause, a safety analysis was reported to show no toxicity signal. Note, patient screening for RECOVERY took into account QTc so higher risk people excluded. @Prof_Marciniak There are two studies showing that more than 10% of covid19 patients developed QT prolongations&gt;50ms even under the regular dosing regimen.

150,"I. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?

Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","D. How can I protect myself 
You can protect yourself by:
-  Washing your hands with soap and running water frequently : before and after eating, after using toilet, touching animals or animal waste
- Covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing - Avoiding close contact with anyone who shows symptoms.
- Seek medical care if you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
#Trending #CoronavirusOutbreak - Have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care
- Do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick G. How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask 
‚Ä¢Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
‚Ä¢Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. - Are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected CoronaVirus Infection ‚Ä¢Avoid touching the mask while using it;
‚Ä¢Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised. H. Does the new coronavirus affect older people

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus However, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. J. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus. However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support. The goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.",0

152,"Can eating garlic help prevent the virus?

Garlic does have antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from outbreak that garlic has protected people from the virus.

Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?","common questions about covid-19 https://t.co/4lsWi6ImPq Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps shouldn‚Äôt be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause cell deaths. 

How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever because of infection with the virus.

They can‚Äôt detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. Due to it taking between 2-10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the virus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the virus.

The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Can rinsing your nose with saline help prevent the virus?

No. There is no evidence that rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from the virus. 

There is some limited evidence that rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. People of all ages can be infected by covid-19. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. 

Are antibiotics effective in treating the virus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. All sources are from the world health organisation website. Everything i‚Äôve posted has been approved and factually checked.

https://t.co/Be5aij5kvh @ReubenR80027912 @gummibear737 what I see coming from you (and friends) is economy &gt; public health and so to get there, and justify that order of importance (since 120K have died), the virus is downplayed.

younger infection is good
herd immunity is the way to go
etc

Public health docs don't agree @ReubenR80027912 @gummibear737 in my view, the way to help the economy is to get control of the virus, not vice versa

and so 'you just want to close the economy' is false. It's a partisan charge.

I want to control the virus to open the economy

Vaccine is the power tool in the toolbox Not the only tool. /fin @gummibear737 @ReubenR80027912 it grows exponentially. That's what's happening in AZ right now before your eyes.

It would be GREAT if herd if immunity was real and easy to achieve. That takes ~70% of the population assuming we're immune after infection (unproven, it's not true for other coronaviruses). But..",0

171,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?
No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.","WHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES, COVID-19 AND HOW ARE THEY RELATED TO SARS?

What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.",0

What is a Coronavirus?
A coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person.","There are 3 currently identified #coronaviruses
1.The MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.

2. The SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China
3. The #COVID19 or the #WuhanCoronovirus COVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms may include:

1.fever 
Anyone with a measured temperature of at least 100.4 ¬∞F [38 ¬∞C]) 
2. Cough
3. Shortness of breath There is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Symptoms of a coronavirus usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor to prescribe pain or fever medication.
As with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest.",0

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 5

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

#FREDIBOAT Part 6

How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this

route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

Not sure how you expect any change when that is what you tout?","@yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC Those people are wasting their time that could be better spent on something that actually exists. @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC I see hundreds of thousands of black people with amassed wealth much greater than my own (and good for them, no issues with that from me). 

I see hundreds of thousands of black business owners, I see a higher education system that does everything it possibly can to recruit... @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC talented black people. I see companies that go out of their way to hire minorities.

Most importantly I see the constitution where it says all men are equal. Finally. ""Systemic racism"" is a thing of the past. Let me be clear. I am not saying there was not a time that it doesn't.. @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC exist, but we led the way in abolishing it.

Am I saying there is not a racist out there here and there that work in these industries you tour as flawed at their core? No, I'm not saying that because that would be ridiculous. If you are trying to get rid of all the racists in the @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC world, I fear you are going to be sorely disappointed in your ability to mold an individual to what you want them to be.  Racists come in all shapes sizes and colors, and should be called out for what they are. But as individuals, not by burning down the systems and institutions @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC that made this country great in the first place.

Racism in our institutions is illegal, and if you can point me to a specific instance where a minority person was targeted or excluded solely because of the color of their skin, I will be the first person to stand right next to @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC you and demand justice for that person.

But the whole thought that the ""systems"" are built and maintained to keep minorities down, right here, right now, is just completely false and all too often used to diminish the responsibility of an individual to chose what they do with @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC their life.

People are put in shitty situations, regardless of skin color. Has more to do with poverty and parents than anything. Some people decide to break the cycle and make something of themselves, others do not. Has NOTHING to do with the amount of melanin in their skin, @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC and all about their willingness to succeed.

Anyway, I am sure this all falls on deaf ears regardless, but trying to explain my position because you asked. @Gee_Whitty @yarbsalocin @rc_outside @JesseKellyDC The mortgage deal has been debunked COUNTLESS times.

234,"How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.","What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. https://t.co/LM6wHFpLd9 Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++ Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

260,"How does Covid-19 spread?
At the moment, we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets. Droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.","As of today,¬†169,906¬†Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in¬†6,644¬†fatalities worldwide. After its discovery last December, in Wuhan, China, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic. How do the seven human
coronaviruses differ?

The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity. How do viruses work?
A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. It enters the cell through binding with receptors and ‚Äúreprogrammes it‚Äù to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body. The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection. There are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. But this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty. How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars, Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?
We cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed. Also, with Covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.

The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since Covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal. It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for Sars-Cov-2 is higher. Although compared to Sars (9.6 per cent) and Mers (34.4 per cent), Covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger. Can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?
For some respiratory viruses this does happen. Not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. In this case, it is still premature to say.",0

270,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

√ò Cough
√ò Fever
√ò Breathing difficulties
Unwell people who have recently travelled from any country with ongoing transmission of COVID-19 ü¶†should immediately contact NCDC on 07032864444 or 0800-97000010 (toll-free).","Am I at risk of catching COVID-19 from a package or products that arrive from countries with a confirmed case(s)?

Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods or packages countries with ongoing transmission. Till date, there is no known case of COVID-19 in Nigeria associated with imported goods. Should I stop my children from going to school?

No. The current situation in the country does not warrant a shutdown of daily activities. During a pandemic, various measures are instituted depending on how serious the illness is and how easily it is spread from person to person. At the moment, there is one confirmed case in Nigeria. Therefore, measures such as school closure or closure of large gatherings, are not required. Persons with persistent cough or sneezing should stay home or keep a social distance, but not mix in a crowd. Is there anything a person can do to avoid becoming infected?

To reduce the risk of infection or spread of COVID-19, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following hand and respiratory hygiene measures: ‚Ä¢ Wash your hands regularly with soap under running water and use hand sanitisers frequently ‚Ä¢ Cover your mouth and nose properly with tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing and immediately dispose of the tissue in a covered waste bin. After this, wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser ‚Ä¢ You may also cough into your elbow if disposable tissue is not available. You are strongly advised not to re-use handkerchiefs ‚Ä¢ If you become sick while travelling, you should avoid close contact with other people while you are symptomatic and cover your mouth and nose with a face mask ‚Ä¢ Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing ‚Ä¢ Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history What can businesses do to protect their staff?

Businesses have an important role to play in protecting their employees. Employers are advised to circulate NCDC‚Äôs public health advisory on COVID-19 to all staff. Encourage sick employees to stay at home if they are unwell. Ensure routine cleaning of high contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. If staff have travelled to any of the countries with ongoing transmission, they should be advised to self-isolate for 14 days.

*Countries with ongoing transmission as at February 28, 2020: China, Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan

No. Antibiotics dont work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment","Protection measures for everyone. 

* Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. 
* Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. *Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. * Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. 
* Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

326,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 

1/3","Let¬¥s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let¬¥s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization.
#CovidfreeApril
#CovidfreePhilippines
#CovidfreeWorld What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19. What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3 Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3 How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3 People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2 However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

330,"THREAD on #COVID19 spread &amp; testing.

How does COVID-19 spread?

It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. Close contact, which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w/a sick individual, increases your risk of catching it. (1/12) 

#COVID19US https://t.co/phLi8f97Dw","My kid is/I am coughing. Should I ask for testing?

Contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Children typically have milder symptoms, more like a common cold‚Ä¶ (2/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ Treatment will not change based on a positive COVID-19 test. Positive or negative, treatment will be fluids, fever-reducing medication, rest, or other supportive care for symptoms‚Ä¶ (3/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ there is currently no treatment specific to COVID-19, so a positive test result only indicates the cause of illness, not any type of treatment‚Ä¶ (4/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ individuals with severe illness from COVID-19 may need hospital care, which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease‚Ä¶ (5/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ Whether you are positive or negative, we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others‚Ä¶ (6/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test OR for 72 hours after your symptoms end, whichever is LONGER‚Ä¶ (7/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ This is different from flu, which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive. No specific treatment for COVID-19 = no different care after a positive test result. (8/12)

#COVID19US Who gets tested? How?

Anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider. If the provider decides a test is needed, they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab‚Ä¶ (9/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ Working with a provider is very important‚Äîa cough and fever can have many causes, so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment‚Ä¶ (10/12)

#COVID19US ‚Ä¶ There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, so if your symptoms are from some other cause, it‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre working with a provider who can help you get well. (11/12)

379,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. https://t.co/OiusUGcg8F People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.

You can protect others from getting sick taking the following precautions 
- When coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with elbow or tissue
- Throw the tissue in a bin immediately after use - Clean hands with soap after coughing or sneezing 
- Avoid close contact when you are experiencing cough and fever
- Avoid spitting in public
- Seek medical care if your loved one have fever, cough or difficulty breathing. - Have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care
- Do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick G. How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask 
‚Ä¢Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
‚Ä¢Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. - Are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected CoronaVirus Infection ‚Ä¢Avoid touching the mask while using it;
‚Ä¢Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised. H. Does the new coronavirus affect older people

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus I. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?

Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support. The goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.",0

That‚Äôs A LOT of death. 
Great catch, Don!","Kudlow to @jaketapper: ‚ÄúHospitalizations may be going up but that‚Äôs because elected procedures are now permitted.‚Äù 

Texas has reported the number of those hospitalized with Coronavirus is at an all-time high. Arizona warned that its ICU‚Äôs are filling up with COVID-19 cases. @biannagolodryga @jaketapper Florida has had several days in a row of record high COVID case reports @imCKindred @biannagolodryga @jaketapper Case reports without context of testing is garbage data. Especially since serological studies show at least 4.3% of FL positive. Why this is lost on the media is ridiculous.  But considering everything is viewed thru stupid political bias it is clear. @bnbeats @imCKindred @biannagolodryga @jaketapper Herd is not anywhere near 80%. The 4.3% was FL not the US.

415,"MYTH-12: DOES THE NEW CORONAVIRUS AFFECT OLDER PEOPLE, OR ARE YOUNGER PEOPLE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

14/n","MYTH-07: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THERMAL SCANNERS IN DETECTING PEOPLE INFECTED WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. 
10/n MYTH-08: CAN SPRAYING ALCOHOL OR CHLORINE ALL OVER YOUR BODY KILL THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes. 

11/n MYTH-09: DO VACCINES AGAINST PNEUMONIA PROTECT YOU AGAINST THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

12/n MYTH-10: CAN REGULARLY RINSING YOUR NOSE WITH SALINE HELP PREVENT INFECTION WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 

13/n MYTH-13: ARE ANTIBIOTICS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

15/n MYTH-14: ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC MEDICINES TO PREVENT OR TREAT THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

455,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties.

465,"What is #herdimmunity threshold for #COVID19?
A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; huge consequences for long term impact. 

New paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially (spoiler: we still don't know value). Thread.
https://t.co/Sgrg1yrlOq","These simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led @mlipsitch to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. Most articles cited the 70% 
*BUT* @mlipsitch knew that...
https://t.co/8dFlzOz4t9 Background: If we know reproductive number R0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (HIT) for WELL-MIXED HOMOGENOUS population is simply 1-1/R0. 
(Note R0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space). Human populations are NOT WELL-MIXED &amp; HOMOGENOUS, so calcs give likely upper bound. 
Q: So what is herd immunity threshold (HIT) for real pops?
A: *Usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness. In idealized population, early vaccination to HIT will prevent outbreak b/c Rt=R0*S/N so Rt&lt;1. However, an epidemic will overshoot HIT &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*R0)). 
For R0=2.5 (reasonable for COVID19 in some pops), HIT=0.6, and f = 0.89. The strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. The citation they give is NOT a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ Matlab files. It's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there. @sbfnk can probably provide best ones 1) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering HIT. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).
2) If some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT. 
3)If some people don't transmit that also reduces HIT. However, see paper by @mgmgomes1 that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than Science paper cited above. Fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects HIT, f, for R0=3; so HIT=0.66, f = 0.94.
https://t.co/P5n0c1tXK1 https://t.co/j44vxDQ9Bq Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect. The take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. NOT well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential ""activity"" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce HIT for R0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. https://t.co/z5XPjIET2e Science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces HIT. It considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts. The conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. https://t.co/yYGDmGEdL5 I'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. But ... What I find puzzling is that this paper is in Science. It's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. It isn't as general as @mgmgomes1 paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. Many older papers say same thing. @mgmgomes1 paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on HIT, f based on data (colored lines in figure). https://t.co/OuxCx8yw5Q Unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for HIT for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does R0). The take home message is want to get to HIT by vaccination NOT infection. Serological data from NYC suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or R0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - I added horiz dashed line).
https://t.co/Mwn4USQ6nk https://t.co/78ozBGuYPo Together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/R0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*R0)), but by how much is still unknown. Ugh. 
@mlipsitch smartly gave a wide range 40-70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions.
https://t.co/S5criybrMz @DiseaseEcology @vcolizza did some work on this in 2007 or so also when I recall correctly: ‚Äú""A programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available."" @guido_leenders @vcolizza This is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial). @DiseaseEcology Are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from HIV or STIs with highly stratified risk groups)?

475,"Q. How long does the virus survive on surfaces?
A. [1/2] Preliminary studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days but this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).","Q. Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?
A. Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods &amp; the risk of catching the virus from a package that has been exposed to different conditions &amp; temperature is very low. [2/2] If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.","The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.
To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?
Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?
No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

Or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day?,"Lot's of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy, but our survey of Albertans would disagree. 

Students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education. The percentages were pretty consistent as well.

Education choice benefits all. #abed https://t.co/ozppEImPJ8 @ColinAitchison This is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted. @karliwithakay @ColinAitchison There is a wealth of research evidence that shows, for example, the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Having publicly-funded charter schools able to innovate and respond to these issues is making things better for kids.",0

1- Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.

2- Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease

3- The new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting COVID-19 cases","8- Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body

9- Can pets at home spread it?
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest it. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water. 4- It CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites

5- Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV

6- UV disinfection lamps should not be used to sterilise hands

7- Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people with a fever¬†but cannot detect infected people 12- Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.

13- People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 10- Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

11- There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline protects people from infection with 2019-nCoV 14- antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. 15- Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

But 400K residents care homes is only 0.6% of the UK population.

What may be happening is care homes are a lot further along the road to herd immunity than the rest of us. @cheianov @JamieWoodhouse @Kit_Yates_Maths @lymanstoneky @andrew_lilico @bajhanlaurence If in a years time 80% of people in care and 80% of the rest of us have been infected, it will all come out in the wash and the iFR will be (probably?) 0.9-1% for the UK, but if right now we have - I dunno - 4% in the community and 20% in care it will artificially raise the IFR. @cheianov @JamieWoodhouse @Kit_Yates_Maths @lymanstoneky @andrew_lilico @bajhanlaurence @ChrisGiles_ The acid test will be what happens to excess deaths after the wave passes.

524,"Q: Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

525,"Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?
No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth busters 
Issa threadüëáüëáüëá Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?
Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. https://t.co/h8kjFn9QfU Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/HN7yBWhYlQ Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/X63kY0i8o3 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?
No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.
However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. https://t.co/KlV6s5lbvH",0

RE: CHA free COVID testing

If one is non-symptomatic and it takes 5+ days after a COVID test to find out the results, how useful is that delayed test result to prevent that person from spreading the virus? My goal before doing a week of vacation and visiting a few people at the end of July is to get tested before I go. But if I'd need to get tested 5-8 days before leaving, is this even a useful exercise? @jeffayc If the people you are visiting are vulnerable, it would be good to get a negative test and then isolate until you see them. @CambMA @CambHealth @jeffayc @CambMA @CambHealth Residents tested at a #CambMA mobile site or CHA's East Cambridge site receive results from @CambHealth. These sites are not designed to help residents make real-time decisions about visits or vacations; they are mainly intended for those w/symptoms or who think they were exposed @jeffayc @CambMA @CambHealth .@CambHealth calls residents within 1-2 days of receiving the test result. If people do not answer the phone or return the call that day, it takes longer to reach them.

#JohnLennon @RollingStone @RegisGalo13 And how many other foreigners have been killed by american guns around the world? @DSzarowski @RollingStone John Lennon is hardly some random famous person. 1.15 million deaths in 35 years by one cause is a lot. @RollingStone 35 years ago, we lost a legend.

555,"First, what is a coronavirus? 
Ulmer: This particular strain started in Wuhan Province. It traveled from animals to humans.
She said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first.","Panelists:
Beaumont Public Health Director Sherry Ulmer
Beaumont Emergency Management Coordinator Tim Ocnashek
BISD Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Anita Frank
From Beaumont Psychiatric Clinic, Jason Mensah Ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in Beaumont or Jefferson County. She said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. With both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.

""We're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.""
""If we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us."" She notes because COVID-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine. Ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in Texas, but Mensah says there are 51.

Ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold. I'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. I know (thanks to #TheDaily I think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.

So, mild is relative here. Ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine. She says that's why it's important to continue ""tried and true"" healthcare methods. Wash your hands, stay home when you're sick. Clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays.

Lysol, Clorox and 409 are CDC-approved to kill the virus.

""We understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours."" Feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. He gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. He's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days. Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. The virus is transmitted person-to-person. She says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets. That's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing. Ulmer said the health department is putting together ""soemthing"" so people know what the next step is if Jefferson County has a confirmed case. (I'm going to use Tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.)
So ... Tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. That includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2 measures. 

I would like to add, as of Friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. The comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. 2/2 Tim says ""we're not trying to scare people. There's a lot of bad information out there.""

He encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on Facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact. ""We would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation."" - Feldshau

He notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. However when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming. ""We are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. Of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations."" Ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. And several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them. Reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.
She said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are ""doing very well.""

""For our children it sounds like God has smiled on us."" Ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would ""tax our healthcare system."" Should the city/county get there, it would have to look at ""alternative"" ways to treat people. She didn't expand on what those alternatives are. Now talking about ""flattening the curve."" People are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.

""This is not here today and gone tomorrow."" -Feldschau She said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up. ""I we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. They can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2 as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus."" 2/2 Feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.

""If we ever lose control, we're going to have a serious problem."" From comment section on the video: 
""If this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) I‚Äôm not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? What is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don‚Äôt do it for flu?"" So even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ... This seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. Someone simply responded ""yassss"" and another said people don't know what to do ""so they just shut everything down I guess.""",0

618,"Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.","The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/HN7yBWhYlQ Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/X63kY0i8o3 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?
No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.
However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. https://t.co/KlV6s5lbvH",0

Regulation and accreditation in the NHS is broad and thorough. It is mirrored, though, across the private sector ‚Äì CQC, GMC, HCPC, UKAS, NHSBT, SHOT and EQA. The regulatory burden is shared. Global shortages make procurement a dog-eat-dog world. Related pressures also meant that testing restrictions were in place. New programmes needed to be developed: lighthouse labs and the Francis Crick Institute are two great examples. QA layers for field labs: UK NEQAS, UKAS visits and visit check list: e.g. operational management, staffing, BCT, liability and indemnity, SOPs, trouble shooting, training, competencies, IQC, EQA, validation, transport, follow-up, sample and specimen reception, PPE and on and on Now running through community testing example of Brent and Harrow CCG.

643,"How does COVID-19 spread?

Initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in Wuhan, China; and was then transmitted to humans. The current version of the SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person-to-person, similar to the flu. This usually happens when a sick person coughs or","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in Wuhan, China.
The virus was previously termed ‚ÄúnCoV-2019‚Äù. At the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2, due to its similarities to the previous What is COVID19?

Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV. The disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the WHO as Coronavirus Disease 2019, or ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms can include: sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters). This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems. ‚Ä¢ Fever
‚Ä¢ Cough
‚Ä¢ Trouble breathing ‚Ä¢ Feeling tired
‚Ä¢ Muscle aches
Most people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death. When should I see a doctor?

If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call 937 (The Saudi MOH Service Center) immediately.
You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days: ‚Ä¢ You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus ‚Äì the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website: https://t.co/dGZNsC4CO8 ncov/travelers/index.html If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. The staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people.
If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead. ‚Ä¢ You had close contact with a person who has the virus ‚Äì This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.
If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go. How is COVID-19 treated?

Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""ICU""). This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others. There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen (e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication. Can COVID-19 be prevented?

There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19:
‚Ä¢ Wash your hands with soap and water often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
o If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
‚Ä¢ CDC does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
o Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to ‚Ä¢ Avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands
‚Ä¢ Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your
hands immediately after (as specified above).
‚Ä¢ Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has COVID-19.
‚Ä¢ Stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to COVID- 19. ‚Ä¢ Keep the sick person away from others ‚Äì The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.
‚Ä¢ Use face masks ‚Äì The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person, ‚Ä¢ Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.
‚Ä¢ Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19.

If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself: you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. This is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask.
‚Ä¢ Be extra careful around body fluids ‚Äì If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.
‚Ä¢ Clean often ‚Äì It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets, and bathroom surfaces. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
‚Ä¢ Wash hands ‚Äì Wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above)
‚Ä¢ You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.
If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time. other people or pets in your home. There is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?
It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area. This way you will be able to receive and share information easily.
If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk. Where can I learn more?

RT to save someone 

1. Hand dryers kill coronavirus

Hand dryers do not kill coronavirus. The best way to protect yourself and others from the virus is to wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.","2. Only older adults and young people are at risk

COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill. 3. Everyone with COVID-19 dies

COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.

In a recent report, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that 80.9% of COVID-19 cases were mild.

You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.","covid-19 myths vs truth https://t.co/QmasHPlOlL You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.

Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous

Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates

From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.

There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus
Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.

To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.  The coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets.",0

What is herd immunity in Ontario for COVID? Based on @imgrund calculations, about 2.1%  with only 1 in 11 cases of COVID detected.
https://t.co/NQ4Dc29whj

Only 2.1% of population has had exposure = NO HERD IMMUNITY AND MUST BE CAREFUL!!","Perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don't matter. But they align very well with what Swiss researchers have found-- 11.6 cases for every 1 case detected. Most of the population of Geneva remains unexposed despite large case number.

https://t.co/SbJk1GNq7e https://t.co/iCeM0lE5hV PLEASE--Wash your hands, wear masks, keep as far away from others and limit interactions. All these actions will help to keep you, your family, your neighbours, and our healthcare system healthy!! So children are usually considered 'vectors of disease' and everyone believes that kids spread germs. But is this true for COVID? Could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are?

Summary work from Irish Health Technology group here...

https://t.co/1m3OzhZwEO ....and a link to the report they have published here üëá

https://t.co/gLl6Aw9i4T What's going on with younger kids? Are they breathing less volume on people (yes, they are smaller)? Talk less forcefully? Do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids? 

Or Is there something fundamentally different in their immune response? Well it looks like policies aimed at kids may have a lesser impact on transmission of coronavirus infections. Implications for school openings. https://t.co/NUVE42U8en Sick Kids Hospital in agreement.

So, 50/50 between these two possibilities. @xamat 50% https://t.co/YXKgAtfUSm @joelgrus @xamat hence the answer is the ""tricky"" d) (which I did not get, because I wasn't watching for strict inequalities and thought I was picking ""greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95"") @xamat =50%. Could use Bayes, but ppl don't understand that so do example:   Suppose 10k ppl tested.  at 5% incidence 500 have antibodies, 9500 don't.  .95*500 = 475 true positives.  0.05*9500 = 475 false negatives.  FN = TP so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5 @xamat 400 person trial. 20 are positive. 380 negative. 361/380 of the negative test negative. 19/20 of the positive test positive.  But 19/380 negative test positive. Any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative. @xamat 0.5 if you are a frequentist. If you are an hypochondriac Bayesian and you work in an hospital with COVID-19 patients, i.e., p(antibodies) &gt; 0.05, then the probability shifts towards 1. @albertlumbreras If you apply Bayes you get the same result. Of course, things change if you change the prior, but that is unrelated to frequentist vs. bayesian. @xamat If I test positive I am either a FP or a TP. The number of FPs is the number of negatives (95% of pop.) x the chance of misclassifying them (5%). The number of TPs is the number of positives (5% of the pop.) x the chance of correctly classifying them (95%). Hence, p=0.5. @xamat P(Covid=Y|test=Y)= P(test=Y|covid=Y) P(covid=Y) / P(test=Y) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5 @xamat Cheeky answer categories! I'm always entertained by how similar Bayes' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other. @xamat 50% https://t.co/UHFkwXiQvR @xamat One of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates @xamat True positives (TP): .95*5%
False positives (FP): .05*95% =  TP
p = TP/(TP+FP) = 50% @xamat But, here is the issue. I can say I have a magical prediction power. Simply, I predict a negative result for everybody. And I win over the lab test.... but I have zero sensitivity! @xamat None of the above. It is 50%",0

759,"Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).","Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

Now. @WHO U can wash your hands as much as you want but evidence indicates to the virus being transferable by aerosols. The Diamond Princess and a case in a Hong Kong flat suggest it is being transferred via the air, not just through droplets.

This government has no crisis management at all. https://t.co/VFpiG1gnLt @WHO What are you going to do to help the poor people of China and Iran, put some pressure on their politicians to be honest. Put pressure on every country to support the Chinese and Iranian people. Stop talking rubbish, do something. Call a pandemic. People, more important than money @WHO Is that it, I cannot believe you want more money to keep telling us that. @WHO The virus can be transferred thru droplets. It can be transmitted through aerosols, if you‚Äôre in the same room as some1 &amp; they are breathing the same air, you can get the virus (masks &amp; eyewear are key). It can be transmitted through urine &amp; faeces - don‚Äôt use public toilets. @WHO I am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across Europe. Strict checks should be in place at every large city for both departures and arrivals in order to mitigate the risk of virus carriers spreading the disease. @WHO I travelled from London to Milan and Paris to London the last few days. Milan, only arrival passengers are being monitored for the disease while Paris Gare du Nord has no measures in place whatsoever.

789,"How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. ¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. What is COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Symptoms 
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.¬† See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?‚Äù",0

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. ¬†As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified. What are the symptoms of someone infected 

It depends on the virus, but common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome Can coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?

Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household workplace, or health care centre Is there a vaccine for a novel coronavirus?

When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can take a number of years for a new vaccine to be developed What can I do to protect myself?

Standard recommendations to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses include maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices ¬†and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms. of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing

Are health workers at risk from a novel coronavirus?

Yes, they can be, as health care workers come into contact with patients more often than the general public.",0

Surprisingly, here the slope is even shallower than the ‚Äòmaximum control‚Äô slope. This suggests there is a feedback present, which decelerates the spread, in the model used to evaluate these strategic options. https://t.co/l2nlT9xuxM The three considered strategic options:

1. No interventions, a worst-case scenario, where the virus is allowed to spread freely (red);
2. Maximum control, a mitigation scenario, where social distancing decelerates the spread (green);
3. Lock-down, a containment scenario, where.. a parameter. An example is the SEIR model this model considers four disease stages:

1. Susceptible: persons that are susceptible to the pathogen, i.e., not immune;
2. Exposed: persons that are exposed to the pathogen, but or not yet contagious; Simplified Epidemic Modelling
Epidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease, a one-way transfer is considered, where persons transfer from one bin to the next. The rate at which persons transfer is described by ... 3. Infected: persons that can spread the pathogen;
4. Recovered: persons that have recovered, i.e., immune;

Figure 2, SEIR model containing four disease stages. https://t.co/g6Ye0pl41K The transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage, e.g., the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters %delta and %gamma.

Figure 3, a parallel SEIR with a severe and asymptomatic  route. https://t.co/iYjQB9VmqA symptomatic persons are in their ‚Äòinfectious bin‚Äô for a longer duration, as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly, i.e., a huge dampening effect. As the pathway through ... asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons.

This parallel SEIR model, when applied to the COVID-19 data available from Wuhan (narrow spike), would yield the following conclusions about the virus: Unfortunately, the parallel SEIR model is in a sense equivalent to a SEIR model that allows for track-trace-isolation (TTI) shown in figure 4.

When the SEIR-TTI model is applied to the Wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus:

1. was moderately infectious;
2. TTI was very effective. The suspected actual used model is more involved, as it is comprised of several age levels, e.g., for each age cohort a more detailed SEIR-TTI equation is applied. When age separation is considered it may have appeared, based on Wuhan data that herd immunity could be build ... relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work (as the R0 would be hugely overestimated, while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated), while vulnerable people kept home.

820,"What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.","Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3 What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 

1/3 Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3 How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3 People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2 However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

825,"Q's 1-17

Q1: What is COVID-19?
A1: It is the acronym for coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-COV-2.

Q2: What is SARS-COV-2?
A2: It is the acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a virus.","It has been an honour working with  Prof Bhaswati Patnaik (Psy) and Prof Navaneeta Rath (Soc) on this FAQ wrt Serological Antibody Test in @bmcbbsr for #COVID19 @HealthCheck_in @IndiaSpend @WHO @ICMRDELHI @utkaluniv01 @NCDS_BBSR @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha https://t.co/DFZ08n9FiP Q3: What is serological antibody test in the context of COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2?
A3: Blood is taken from the veins and the serum/plasma put to a test to know whether the person has developed antibodies against the virus, SARS-COV-2, for the disease, COVID-19. Q5: Who would have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19?
 A5: Only people who were infected by SARS-COV-2 and had the disease COVID-19 are likely to have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19. Q4: How long it takes to give the result of the serological antibody test?
A4: It takes 15-30 minutes to get the result of the test. So, it is a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Q6: Why is the test conducted on population who are not known to have COVID-19?
A6: Some people might have been infected but were either asymptomatic or were with symptoms but have not been tested. Hence, the test is conducted on population who are not known to have it. Q7:  Why the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar, not in other cities of Odisha?
A7: As Bhubaneswar has been declared as a hotspot and there is likelihood for the rapid spread in the city and from the city to other cities, the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar. Q8: What is the purpose of the test?
A8:  The purpose of the test is to help in disease surveillance. It will help us arrive at an estimate of how many people from different categories of population in Bhubaneswar that might have been affected. Q9:  Apart from random sampling for testing the population, who else can go for the antibody test?
A9: Samples of people with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza like Illness (ILI) are also being collected apart from random sampling of asymptomatic people. Q10: Who will identify the population and design the sample to be tested?
A10: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) through experts from the health department have developed protocols for identifying population from among whom the sample is to be drawn for testing. Q11: What will happen if the antibody test comes positive?
A11: If the antibody test comes positive, the person‚Äôs swab samples may be sent for RT-PCR test. This is another confirmatory test to know whether the person is currently suffering from COVID-19. Q.12: Will serological antibody test help identify a person suffering from COVID-19?
A12: No, as per current practise and guidelines from @WHO &amp; @ICMRDELHI, COVID-19 +ve cases are to be identified through RT-PCR in designated laboratories/testing centres. Q13: Will identifying people who have developed antibodies be helpful in treatment for those who are suffering from COVID-19?
A13:  An independent research protocol has to be developed where plasma from those who developed antibodies can be used to treat patients. Q14: Will those identified with antibodies for COVID-19 be immune from the disease?
A14: Further research with people who have already developed antibodies will be required. Q.15: Whom should the residents of the city contact for the test?
A15: The residents of the city may contact their respective RWA (Resident Welfare Association), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) or ward officer for the test. Q17: How many rapid kits have been provided to Government of Odisha in the first phase?
A17: @ICMRDELHI has provided 6000 rapid kits for the test to Odisha in the first phase.

@bmcbbsr @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha Q16: Where from these rapid kits have come to the state?
A16: These rapid kits have been procured by @ICMRDELHI and have been supplied to Odisha. The Odia version of the policy brief FAQs on rapid antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 is now put up by @NCDS_BBSR

Out of the total number of Missourians tested, it is the percentage that have had a positive test result.","For June 1, that percentage was 6.5% for PCR tests and 4% for Serology tests. https://t.co/6iLd4i4el6 You can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in Missouri, and how many of those were positive. If you view that table, you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable, while the total number of tests daily has increased.

828,"1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.","The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.

Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ 2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth). 4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. 7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support. 6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets. 5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water. 8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. 10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.",0

Idk it just seems so blown out of proportion :/ @swiftlyamanda13 I think instead of closing they should just let people who are not healthy, old, immunocompromised, etc, leave and stay home from things without consequences. It seems much easier to do that than close everything for everyone @swiftlyamanda13 It is being blown out of proportion.

@WHO @NCDCgov","Good morning everybody...in light of the recent influx of false information about the COVID-19 virus, we have decided as a hub to hold a live tweet chat with our distinguished medical professional @Ovdiasis to shared more light on this issue and answer any questions  you have https://t.co/z02qpXBuIm Our guest , Dr Nyeche Ovundah is a renowned Medical practitioner at the Rivers State Teaching Hospital.

He is a Resident at the Internal Medicine Department.

Welcome @Ovdiasis .

#COVID19 https://t.co/SFveYiwEdZ Hello @Ovdiasis!

Over the weeks now, a condition #COVID19 has had rising attention on the media, what is COVID 19? What symptoms will an individual infected with COVID19 present with @Ovdiasis?

How long does it take from infection to presentation of symptoms of COVID 19 and how long can one be contagious? As a Hub, with the healthy state of people at heart @Ovdiasis, we are also a bit curious about how best can one protect him or herself with the recent outbreak.

Is there any known treatment for COVID19? @phglobalshapers @WHO @NCDCgov It is called a pandemic because this previously unknown disease has spread from a particular locality to all over the world... A pandemic is a disease outbreak that has spread over several countries or continents... Another popular disease that is a pandemic is HIV/AIDS. Could you please tell us the difference between Self isolation and Quarantine and why is it important we maintain social/physical distance during this COVID19 period?

Please shed more light on how can we protect our loved ones from getting infected when self-isolating @Ovdiasis In this period of uncertainty and isolation at home due to COVID19, what advice can we give people to help experience a sense of normalcy, hope and mental stability?

@Ovdiasis 
@WHO 
@NCDCgov Fo clarity sake @Ovdiasis, what is the criteria for COVID19 testing in Nigeria?

What centers in Nigeria can carry out COVID 19 testing? Is the testing free and what is the estimated waiting time for results? Do you think the measures taken by the Rivers State Government to enforce isolation and prohibition of public gatherings in order to contain the spread of the virus is enough @Ovdiasis?

What lessons can be applied from the response to Ebola outbreak, to combat COVID19 outbreak? As a Medical practitioner @Ovdiasis, what suggestions do you have to improve our Preparedness/response to COVID19?

How can Civil Society, Academia, Government, the Private sector and the general public work together to stem the Outbreak of COVID19 in Rivers State? Dr @Ovdiasis, How do you assess the implementation of the preventive measures taken so far by the RVSG?

Do you feel the 23 LGA's in Rivers would be adequately catered for in case of an outbreak of COVID19 in the state? In your own understanding as a Heathcare Professional, Dr @Ovdiasis, what supplies are most important to be gotten and kept during this pandemic period?

 If someone absolutely has to go out, what should he/she do? What should one do if they experience symptoms and can't get help through Govt Hospitals/no isolation centres in their state  @Ovdiasis?

What practical steps can be taken to protect the vulnerable groups like people with underlying medical issues/ immune compromised individuals? In rounding up Dr @Ovdiasis, what is the protocol if i suspect i have COVID 19 in Rivers state?

What is the National and Rivers State COVID 19 emergency help lines? It's been an amazing and insightful  conversation Dr @Ovdiasis and I must confess we have learnt so much.

In conclusion, how can the Port Harcourt Global Shapers Community better contribute to the response to COVID19? Thank you so much @Ovdiasis. We do not take for granted the time you have spent teaching us. 

We know a lot of our followers have questions to ask, please join us for a telegram discourse as regards COVID19 with our Guest Dr Ovundah by 8pm today.

At what level of the collectives should a UBI be established? (Note: I have not said whether I am for or against a UBI.)","@janellekz @AMidKnight western people are somewhat confined to thinking about individuals instead of the systems that they are a part of, create, and sustain.

https://t.co/HgwmpTSzRY @ByronWoodson @AMidKnight I actually just watched that video fairly recently, at @conways_law request. üíú

To solve these sorts of problems, we definitely need systems thinking. I'm reasonably educated in this area.

Also spent many years working in semiconductor, on SPC &amp; supply chain infrastructure. @ByronWoodson @janellekz @conways_law I can see what you‚Äôre saying. Thank you. I think part of the issue is that I don‚Äôt think in hierarchies or boundaries. Why does ‚Äúsystems thinking‚Äù tend to go bigger instead of smaller?

Person = rose (for now)
Pedals = mind
Stem = body

To be continued. :) @ByronWoodson @janellekz @conways_law What about:

Washington state = rose
Pedals = citizen (person)
Stem = government (people)

United States = rose‚Ä¶North America = rose‚Ä¶World = rose

Each pedal has its own needs (notice they don‚Äôt all fall at once). To your point, there is a supply chain‚Ä¶at every scale. @ByronWoodson @janellekz @conways_law The original principle still applies. Some of the roses (for you) or pedals, or cells will be able to adapt - others won‚Äôt - trying to make reactions go faster though, tends to result in a smaller yield, I think. @AMidKnight @janellekz @conways_law almost all rose bushes can recover from mites, mold, and other vermin if they are properly fed and watered. 

their survivability is not an innate trait but an effect of the relationship with their environment/context. @AMidKnight @janellekz @conways_law what's failing is the system that arranged these 350 million this way (see: DJIA collapse, international travel rates and lockdowns, etc ).

if we implement UBI so the 350m can buy their food reliably for 12 months, life will be peachy, but the oligarchy and corporatocracy won't @AMidKnight @janellekz @conways_law accept is a mental state

we need it because the current system of distribution (Fed loans to commercial loans to payrolls) is pretty much at a standstill and restarting will take a decade.

Unlikely.,"This article intrigued me.  https://t.co/BzjprpNqXr  So, unless I have missed reading something important, the early release of lockdown is precisely what is going to put us into the worst of both worlds. On the assumption that regulated social distancing has added to the economic cost paid up front, in that what we saw would not have happened with purely private social distancing...  if we release now without enough test trace isolate [sorry, very boring to continue to repeat]... ...then we'll have created a &gt; recession than needed for little gain, as we go back to a let the virus rip strategy.  What gain there will have been will have been purely about trimming the top off the 'curve' [ie reducing peak case load] and reducing mortality from lack of care. @t0nyyates Seems like a second wave is modestly unlikely...

927,"9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold
All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.","2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk
SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected. Thread about some popular myths on corona virus

1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body
Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin

These cannot kill viruses within the body!! 6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus
Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus

https://t.co/speJA9BUHu 7. Face masks protect against coronavirus
Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.
https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa 8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus
Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19
As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.

So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray. Shambho Mahadevaüôè 10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus
Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses. 14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus
Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons
COVID-19 symptoms only 2‚Äì10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with. 9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans. @avanya06604007 @PraneyD @Ateendriyo @DimpleAtra  @radvind @ganesh_kala59 @Iyerpatriot @lalitha_jr @Kalpesh_IR @tweets_tinku @DimpleAtra",1

Cmq √® ulteriormente complesso perch√® nn √® banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia ""la vera scienza"". @LucioMM1 @mindtapes La domanda secondo me √® assolutamente legittima. Non √® che √® posta male, ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti. ""A chi devo fare riferimento?"", ""di chi mi devo fidare"", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso. @LucioMM1 @mindtapes La comunit√† scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi √® ci√≤ che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalit√†. A prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza. @KegOfGrog @mindtapes ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. Burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi. ""state a casa"" nn √® un claim scientifico. E' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. Non √® scienza / @KegOfGrog @mindtapes scienza √® dire ""se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce"". Il ""quindi state a casa a qualunque costo"" non √® scienza. @LucioMM1 @mindtapes No. L'OMS ha detto che stare a casa √® il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. Non probabilmente. Lo hanno affermato con certezza. Ed √® confermato dai numeri. 
Non lo dice Burioni, n√© nessun altro. Lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanit√†. @KegOfGrog @mindtapes cmq no, √® scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa √® uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. Se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. Partendo da l√¨, possiamo capire come il dire cosa ""minimizza"" nn serve mai a nulla. @LucioMM1 @mindtapes Quindi secondo te l'OMS dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? A che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chiss√† quanta gente √® contagiata? @LucioMM1 @mindtapes Se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio √® l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione. @KegOfGrog @mindtapes definisci ""migliore"". Nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. Poi politica sceglie con loro ZITTI MENTRE SI SCEGLIE. @LucioMM1 @mindtapes La politica anche √® responsabile della ""intromissione"" degli scienziati, eh. Se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani. @KegOfGrog @mindtapes ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. Loro devono dire ""chiusura fabbrica impatta X su tassi di contagio"". Poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori.",0

964,"Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?

 No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.","There are lots of other reasons for good hygiene around pets, though. Some common bacteria can pass between animals and people, such as E.coli and Salmonella. Washing your hands with soap and water can guard against them. Who is most at risk?

In the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 8,422 people were infected and there were 916 deaths worldwide. The overall death rate for infected people was 11%. But for infected people 24 and younger, the death rate was just 1%, while¬†for those aged 65+ it was 55%. In short, anyone can catch a virus. But the effect it will have on you, and how seriously ill you might become, can be dependent on several other factors. Older people and anyone with¬†pre-existing medical conditions, like asthma, diabetes or heart disease, appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus, according to the WHO. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Can gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus?

 No. There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus. Some brands or mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection. The World Health Organization recommends taking the following precautions:

1. Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water 2. When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue ‚Äì throw tissue away immediately and wash hands 3. Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough

4. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your healthcare provider 5. When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals 6. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.",0

1 What are coronaviruses, what is COVID-19 and how is it related to SARS?

*What is a coronavirus?*

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

*What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 6

How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

#FREDIBOAT Part 11

many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.¬†

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this 
#FREDIBOAT Part 14 

route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 15

Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating

#FREDIBOAT Part 16

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

The virus that causes COVID-19 probably emerged from an animal source, but is now spreading from person to person. 

The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)","From respiratory (saliva, nasal mucus,) droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

 It also may be possible that a person

Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

1011,"Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia","Q. What is a CoronaVirus?
A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. 
#coronavirus #coronavirusindia Q. What is COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. [2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia Q. How does COVID-19 spreads?
A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates [2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus [3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages. [2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia",0

Forget the glamorous results you see, people's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly.","I moved to another city and drowned myself in Bishop David Oyedepo's book - UNDERSTANDING DIVINE DIRECTION. 

I tried applying for jobs during this period and never did I get one. See, I have a very great CV, good schools, excellent grades and awesome work experience. As at that time, I had worked for an Impact Accelerator and Consulting firm in Nairobi, did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences. The first test invite I got, I passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day. I was equally successful and was called to see the CEO which was the last stage of the recruitment process. Maybe my price scared them, I was not called back as promised. The second one I ever got much later, I argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything. LOL. 

I didn't get both jobs. Thank God. I am sure God was looking at me and shaking his head like ""see this boy I gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else"". Discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly. This does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work. You will work extra hard and even harder as you go up. Succeeding is easy. Staying successful is not. Many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself 'why not me?' When will it be my own turn? Do they have two heads? etc. 

No! Nothing is wrong with you. Just discover your own lane and press forward. YOU ARE YOU!!! Most people will not even write about their failures. I AM SUPER PROUD OF MY FAILURES. I failed forward. My failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business. Your failures are a plus. You learn never to do things that same way. Reason I embraced the lean approach. I learnt how to start a business with a very little cost, validate and then grow it. https://t.co/SWKhjcXLsr (@ePoultryNG) is a clear example. I will tell the story some day By God's Grace (ALL GLORY TO GOD), doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from President Obama through his Foundation, the Dutch Government, The Wharton School, Ventures Platform, Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria... Others are Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) - a network of 121 Vice Chancellors of African Universities, Federal Government of Nigeria, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)... Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Embassy of France in Nigeria, Bank of Industry, African Entrepreneurship Awards, Morocco, and several others. Because of my work as an entrepreneur, I have had FREE, and I mean COMPLETELY FREE trips to some countries in Africa and Europe. It looks like I am bragging but I am actually not. There were times I applied for these things - put myself forward, pushed and pushed and I always got a NO! For me to share one award, recognition or free travel that came my way, I may have gotten NOs in a multiple of 10, if not 20. There is a particular annual fellowship I have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years. I will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected. That is how it is. You have to develop a thick skin to getting NOs, see them as part of the process and forge ahead. You have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly. You have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race. Do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition. We are not wired to do the same things. 

You also have to stay HUMBLE. Little accolades should not get to your head. If it does, your dreams are so small. Increase the elasticity. That does not mean you will not celebrate your wins. Celebrate them. Enjoy them. But you know what, move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more. I HAVE MY STORY! YOU HAVE YOURS! 

They are never the same even though our results might be similar. It could even bring us plenty money and fame. But it is never the same. Finally, success is not even about the money and the fame alone. It is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled. Only that, money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter. 

Just find your lane, stay there and run your race. 

Dazzol.

Blessed weekend.",0

1084,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","Let¬¥s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let¬¥s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization.
#CovidfreeApril
#CovidfreePhilippines
#CovidfreeWorld Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3 Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3 How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3 People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3 Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2 However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

1090,"9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.","1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. 2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?

No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth). 4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. 7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support. 6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets. 5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water. 8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.",0

1106,"What is a coronavirus? 
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS.
The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19.","I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.

It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A. What is COVID-19? 

COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.

Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. 

People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. How likely am I to catch COVID-19? 

The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. Should I worry about COVID-19? 

Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. 

It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT","Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT Part 28

and other viruses.

If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

1167,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?

ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

üí¶ The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. ü•Ñ These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 

üëà Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

‚ÜîÔ∏è People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

1169,"Q. What is a CoronaVirus?
A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. 
#coronavirus #coronavirusindia","Q. What is COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. [2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia Q. How does COVID-19 spreads?
A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates [2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.

1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.

2/10 3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.

3/10 4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).

4/10 5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).

5/10 6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.

6/10 7. Pull down the mask‚Äôs bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.

7/10 8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.

1178,"Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.","The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.

Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

https://t.co/XJImWlY3j8 https://t.co/OOKb1WjyUI These myths might seem absurd to many of us.

It's clear though that this kind of misinformation continues to circulate widely (and maybe not in the groups that we are a part of). https://t.co/66uYi4JA9j As a healthcare community, we need to re-establish ourselves as the voices of reason. 

Where this starts, however, is with independent and critical appraisal of the best available evidence by each and every one of us. If we aren't reading the papers and pointing out flaws in internal and external validities, who will?

And most importantly, if we aren't appraising and translating the evidence into something the public can understand, who will? We need to continue to support and strengthen the voices of those who take the time to provide balanced assessments through this unique time. 

Shout out to @First10EM @PulmCrit 

Share some of your favorite voices with me. The media (and that includes reputable sources) will continue to simplify and sensationalize scientific news.

Indiscriminate sharing of articles summarizing papers and posts with one-liners from abstracts only perpetuates and validates this.",0

What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019.","WHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES, COVID-19 AND HOW ARE THEY RELATED TO SARS?

What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?
No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.",0

Not","*What are the treatment options for COVID-19 (including drugs, vaccines, therapies)?*

üíä *Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?*
No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. 

üß™ *Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?*

While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.

Why? This tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the U.S. and 30 million around the world. That's millions too many. https://t.co/nvzOWYbOuk Scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious COVID-19 is specifically. This is called R0 value. It measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. This is how COVID-19's R0 values compare to other diseases. https://t.co/BzRjrVVXvb For this to work, 70 percent of the population would need to have immunity. That's 229,767,666 people in the U.S. alone. https://t.co/fwVs57MhDq Experts also noted that by social distancing, we can mimic this tactic. Staying six feet away from others also prevents the virus from bouncing to a new person. Until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain.

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.","How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating

#FREDIBOAT Part 16

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

1323,"The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.
To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.","Just as fast as the virus has spread so has the misinformation surrounding COVID - 19 which can be equally as harmful. In this thread you‚Äôll find many of the popular theories debunked as outlined by the @WHO . 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19

Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. 

COVID-19 is spread through respiratoatry droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

Evidenced by the surge here at home you can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have had numerous cases. Black People Can Get Corona.

Data on race and the virus is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions, but disparate rates of sickness and death have emerged in some places.

COVID - 19 is infecting and killing black people in the US at disproportionately high rates. @nytimes",0

There is the added benefit of lower oil - adjusted for $ appreciation + drop in demand - it shd still be a good $10-15bn. W/almost ALL our public debt financed locally, we have substantial fiscal policy freedom. Time to use it for Indians, instead of saving it for rating agencies Last but not least, stability of financial system has to be maintained. Tons of tools in tht kit - but the real one is simple - prevent a bank run. There is an easy soln - for the next 6 mths, nationalise ALL bank depos. Not the banks, but extend sovereign g'tee to depos.. @deepakkutty @somnath1978 Simple phsycological ploy to avoid any potential bank run till crisis subsides..... Last thing any government wants in this situation.....",0
1363,"MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT CORONA VIRUS ACCORDING TO WHO
Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.
There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless","of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there's no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new virus. #coronavirusindia https://t.co/hmhPgXPvX6","#coronavirusindia 
Its important to be alert but not scared. 

India has 13966000 episodes of seasonal influenza linked lower respiratory tract infections &amp; about 26000 deaths A YEAR. 

The new virus is less deadly than say H1N1 &amp; harms mostly the very young, v old, &amp; v weak. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected. Older people, &amp; people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill https://t.co/A93P4kaZHV Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus &amp; therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

#coronavirusindia https://t.co/3KtR8P3lQq Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

1432,"So people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies (serology) from the total. Is this consistent with what is being observed?
#COVID19 
9/x","As a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. It is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease.
#COVID19
8/x A ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as SAR-CoV-2. But is this assumption always correct?
#COVID19
7/x Most serologic assays have ranged from 1-3% all the way up to 20-30% in areas such as New York City. And the curve seems to be ending in NYC.  What gives?
#COVID19
10/x Another fascinating study of a ship expedition to the Antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected.
H/T @vmontori 
#COVID19 
14/x
https://t.co/vCU1r6eTpj Similarly, in a recent study of an isolated Alpine community in Austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected.
#COVID19
11/x
https://t.co/Cm1oOVu6sq It seems the pandemic has stopped in that community, with a high antibody prevalence of 42.4%. Notably, children were less likely to be infected.
#COVID19
12/x In another study, it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected, with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ACE2 receptor.
#COVID19 
13/x
https://t.co/9dCFn1sNuL So it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific SAR-COV-2 protective antibodies.
#COVID19 
15/x The most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human/primates/mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses.
#COVID19 
17/x How could this be? Is it possible not all are likely to be infected? I suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. I will share two possibilities others have explored.
#COVID19 
16/x How could we be protected? It is impossible to tell. Our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science.  Maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. We might never know. But we do know evolutionary pathways select
#COVID19 
19/x This is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure. Perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past! Thank you!
#COVID19 
18/x
https://t.co/BHgM1pgd3w https://t.co/7eN7N65DZg This study was small but very provocative. If confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the ""S"" (as in susceptible). In other words, you can be functionally ""immune"" even if not exposed
#COVID19
21/x
https://t.co/SiVFzgVaK5 Another possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. One such study has shown that as a possibility. They found T cell reactivity from viable T cells stored before SARS-CoV-2. In nearly one-half of cases!
#COVID19 
20/x
https://t.co/F9PSvm0yPk It would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick. Low hanging fruit!
#COVID19
23/x https://t.co/uEjyNC7O3w Importantly, and somewhat obvious, they will not have typical SAR-CoV-2 antibodies. But they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses.
#COVID19 
22/x Modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies.
#COVID19 
24/x It is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. That would explain why there are clusters among families or friends.  And also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers.
#COVID19
25/x Globally we have heard from colleagues in Peru, Ecuador and Greece saying ‚Äúthe parking lots were full, we had no more beds.  They are gone‚Äù
#COVID19
26/x The problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible, and how is not.  I do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures.  But hopefully this give you hope.

27/x @Vmontori highly recommends I read the A Camus book. Highly descriptive of the current situation.

1439,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.","and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China. It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States.
In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",0

#PEDULIAWA19 https://t.co/EtcjBolSMC Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

#PEDULIWA19 https://t.co/51REszkGe3 has been named¬†coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)¬†‚Äì ‚ÄòCO‚Äô stands for corona, ‚ÄòVI‚Äô for virus, and ‚ÄòD‚Äô for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‚Äò2019 novel coronavirus‚Äô or ‚Äò2019-nCoV.‚Äô

#PEDULIWA19 The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.

#PEDULIWA19 How does the COVID-19 virus spread?

The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. 

#PEDULIWA19 The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for a few hours to several days, but simple disinfectants can kill it. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets, rather than through the air. How can I protect myself and others from COVID-19?

#PEDULIWA19 1. Wash your hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub¬†

#PEDULIWA19 https://t.co/RpOfRdsH2t 2. Cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of used tissue immediately

#PEDULIWA19 https://t.co/iWU2Q8z8ow 3. Avoid close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms

#PEDULIWA19 https://t.co/vOR3Mybus7 4. Seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing

#PEDULIWA19 https://t.co/nEOVHO97kr What is the best way to wash hands properly?

Step 1: Wet hands with running water

Step 2: Apply enough soap to cover wet hands

Step 3: Scrub all surfaces of the hands ‚Äì including back of hands, between fingers and under nails ‚Äì for at least 20 seconds.

#PEDULIWA19 If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water, if hands are visibly dirty.

#PEDULIWA19 Step 4: Rinse thoroughly with running water

Step 5: Dry hands with a clean cloth or single-use towel

Wash your hands often, especially before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and going to the bathroom

Yes younger people (under 55/60) are mildly effected for the most part (unless you have a preexisting illness). But any age is still just as contagious as the next. You can have COVID-19 and not show a single symptom. Then go visit your grandparent/parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint. So many people are so uneducated on COVID-19. Yes the media has completely overblown this. The only way to allow the medical field to catch up is SOCIAL DISTANCE yourself. If you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly (e.i. China &amp; Italy) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with COVID-19 that may or may not be in a critical condition. On top of that that, it‚Äôs the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up, then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out. It‚Äôs not a beat it, it‚Äôs a slow it down. As young people in society it‚Äôs our duty to slow this virus down. Avoid social gatherings, avoid large crowds, wash your fucking hands, wipe down machines at the gym, socially distance yourself.

Not abolishing the virus as herd would, but it‚Äôs ability to spread is extremely limited in NY. @AlexBerenson If you are uncovering asymptomatic infections in a major way, we are closer to the end of the pandemic than most people realize. Isn‚Äôt it the darkest before dawn? @AlexBerenson National action requires a Pelosi Congress, who would allocate everybody's savings away and destroy the economy.

This has always been the plan. It was done against Bush with not even a twitch, and they expect to do it again. @AlexBerenson The testing and metrics for case positive numbers are shit. Positive because u maybe talked to someone with covid?????  This whole situation is completely fucked with a bunch of morons pointing to data that is worthless out of the gate. Junk in junk out.  Open the country NOW @strivepositive @AlexBerenson I hope you are right. I want this over. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. We are being scammed. @AlexBerenson In Brazil this information is coming from blood banks, which test every donation. In Rio de Janeiro the antibody rate went from 4% in April to 14% in May, and 28% in the beginning of June.

In the US the Red Cross should certainly have this info. Why isn't it available? @AlexBerenson Antibody tests are important if for no other reason, they still don't know how long the antibodies last and/or resist reinfection.  No one has yet to be able to answer that but I assume they are still testing to determine? Who knows? @foogatwo @AlexBerenson Earlier tonight there was a report that North Carolina antibody testing showed 17% exposure implying a very low IFR which would mean the virus has fewer to infect and is not as lethal to those it does. @AlexBerenson Also, vaccines are more lucrative than good old cheap common sense herd immunity. @pauliemitch @AlexBerenson Why did they scream in March we need more tests. Now we are doing it and now they are like shut it down. The left gives me a headache. @AlexBerenson I thought NIH was doing this? I volunteered but apparently was not selected.. @AlexBerenson Because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity's work. Harris County's mask edict has just been extended until late August. By which time this would have been over any way. But now the can say ""see! Look at what my mask edict accomplished!"" @thefruitpanch @AlexBerenson Arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days. @AlexBerenson Compare to other countries -- if we are so far behind then other countries must assuredly be ahead of us.

I don't think it's that easy.   In the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful. @AlexBerenson Gotta make it last to November, then it will all go silent @GertzJack1 @AlexBerenson Remember when Birx said on April 1, 2020,‚Äùthere is no more flu‚Äù. After that day any flu deaths were counted as Covid. We stupidly went along and believed anything they said. @Bam4022bam @AlexBerenson Are you new to this?  That‚Äôs a pretty common sun-tues rate of change. @AlexBerenson What about the CDC anti body testing done in late March/early April? @AlexBerenson In the early days everyone said this can‚Äôt be a hoax because the whole world is locking down. Ok. Fair. Now flip the situation: why is only the US locking down (to this extent) again? ü§î @AlexBerenson And T-Cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies.  New York, Italy, etc seems to show that we're nearing herd immunity, like it or not. @AlexBerenson So what is the end game here, who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic ? The only semblance of  malice I can think of is that some public health experts have a tiny bit more amount of fame. @AlexBerenson Red Cross,in VA at least, is testing every person donating blood for Covid19 antibodies. For a limited time. @AlexBerenson Lowest US death total for a Tuesday since March 25. I imagine Team Apocalypse will still be screaming for lockdowns when we hit zero deaths. @AlexBerenson You and others with a big audience must keep asking for this and promoting it until decision makers get it. Keep up the great work! @AlexBerenson Right after the election @AlexBerenson Same thing is happening in Houston

https://t.co/Yp8uS98Epc @AlexBerenson Great work Alex.  Of the recent pandemics which ones have the designed successful vaccines?
AIDS/hiv, colds, sars, mers, h1n1?   They only get the flu right every once in a while. @AlexBerenson Governor Polis just shut down bars for 30 days. @AlexBerenson @stephiegal @cdc is actively discouraging companies, universities etc from doimg any antibody testing. @G8rMom7 @AlexBerenson My bro works for a biotech company who makes Covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly (unlike influenza) there should be lasting immunity. Which also means if enough people get it, it will fade away completely. Just like SARS and MERS (both coronaviruses) @AlexBerenson Elections..... @AlexBerenson Meanwhile Arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care.

Antibody tests that are positive for ANTIBODIES is like having your own vaccine on board.
Do more testing for antibodies, viral tests when symptomatic.

Or close.  But the evidence will be, I think, on Worldometer or similar.  Deaths for sure are WAY down.  Let's see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon.  I hope so. @AlexBerenson Posting this again. This seems to be correct.

https://t.co/3bZQReQoB6 @AlexBerenson And this:

https://t.co/iFd9UmCjmM @AlexBerenson Did you see this study from Karolina ka in Sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people don‚Äôt produce antibodies but produce an effective T cell immune response? https://t.co/9LaLpLgMkD @AlexBerenson New York City antibody results were over 20% two months ago. I would expect that they are much higher now, but there has been silence on that issue. @AlexBerenson Assuming 20% positive on NYC antibody test, that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from NYC alone. @AlexBerenson My guess is the real antibody results in NYC are much higher, which is good news, not bad news, of course, because it leads to herd immunity. @AlexBerenson It's even more fundamental. ""Novo"" Wuhan virus found in waste water samples in Spain - in early 2019. The whole Fauci narrative was BS from Day One.  The deaths are seasonal, predictable and many are the result of malpractice https://t.co/n2Wtq3wTdv @AlexBerenson @tan123 Of course, they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50% but not antibody testing.  It's like the media wants to propagate the scam, as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the country's popularity or something. @AlexBerenson It‚Äôs irrelevant because by Fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero. They won‚Äôt be able to hide that glaring fact. @AlexBerenson I suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming, since it endangers the narrative. @AlexBerenson We will not see a widespread, accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot. @AlexBerenson The CDC has shown itself to be another incompetent, self perpetuating Government bureaucracy.  Random Covid19 testing should have started in January 2020.   Without random testing you have no idea of what‚Äôs happening.   The CDC is clueless. @AlexBerenson The CDC says for every 1 case we identified, there were at least 10 we didn‚Äôt.  Fauci claimed yesterday the US would see 100,000 cases per day. Do the math.  We have been well over his number for some time.  We are now identifying those by testing people who aren‚Äôt ill. @AlexBerenson And two months ago they said that‚Äôs what needed to happen, more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms.  Now they are saying that‚Äôs bad bad because, well that‚Äôs a lot of cases.  I feel like we are being punked. @AlexBerenson Nefarious? They want this to continue? Or incompetence? @AlexBerenson @MarcLobliner Pharmaceutical industrial complex @AlexBerenson So let‚Äôs just let it spread and we will find out. @AlexBerenson https://t.co/nxm60x6kei has FDA EUA approved Covid- 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities! This will help identify those with antibodies! @AlexBerenson Come on @realDonaldTrump why are you giving us this information? @AlexBerenson Antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around. Talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry, molecular, or microbiology field, they will tell you the same thing. @AlexBerenson Um...no.

I don't know if you noticed, but New York was a bit tense while all that was going on @AlexBerenson Ôøº
""New research from Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 demonstrate so-called T-cell-mediated immunity to the new coronavirus, even if they have not tested positively for antibodies."" @andrewbostom @AlexBerenson Great article! üëç @AlexBerenson Probably because they're saying the tests are inaccurate. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è @AlexBerenson @erinhaust What are you referring to in NC? @AlexBerenson They are all going to deny herd immunity until November 4.

Mental midgets. @AlexBerenson @KMGVictoria Well you live in NY - enjoy. @AlexBerenson While good news, think we‚Äôve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity. @AlexBerenson Alex, what‚Äôs happening in N.C. haven‚Äôt seen any stats. Their website is not much help. No actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies.
cc: @RoyCooperNC @DanForestNC @AlexBerenson What is happening in NC?  A little background of truth.  NC is JUST NOW starting to test Nursing Home residents and workers in the facilities.  JUST now.  50% of NC deaths are from Nursing homes. @AlexBerenson Looking at the real stats.

https://t.co/UxnXQXreNi @AlexBerenson What‚Äôs happening in NC? What did I miss? @AlexBerenson The NC study is not randomized. These volunteers are self selected. I haven't requested an antibody test because I don't think I have had the virus. Please stop calling it a randomized study. @AlexBerenson Why is @realDonaldTrump not demanding this? @AlexBerenson According to these Swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x!  NYC could easily be at 60% if they are right.  https://t.co/4GmbMhEQPT @AlexBerenson @asha_donga Blame the idiot in chief
#TrumpKillsUS @AlexBerenson What is happening in NC? @AlexBerenson It‚Äôs funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid/ anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago. @AlexBerenson We don't know because the CDC is not treating this ""viral disease"" like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance. They are treating it like a political bludgeon. Clear data would hamper their mission. @AlexBerenson https://t.co/Kuf0NvTvBR

Another day another article. ..

Now they say test for T-cells and not for antibodies. ..

"" For every person testing positive for antibodies, two were found to have specific T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.""

Do we know what to test ? @MarioGonnet @AlexBerenson Is that when the often mentioned T- cells come into the picture? @gap1178 @AlexBerenson SMH. So why hasn't Gov Abbott been mentioning this of late, if at all? @couchsecurity @AlexBerenson Yikes. That makes sense. But it's so sickening in it's sneakiness. @l_o_v_e_truth @AlexBerenson @VP @GovAbbott Can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me, if it's possible to have both T cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen? Or do the T cells (if present) automatically override/ cancel out the ABs? @athenas13 @AlexBerenson @tan123 REALLY?? @HumbleCitizen5 @AlexBerenson Agreed!Vaccine is aqcuired immunity in the herd, otherwise it's natural herd immunity. People that think vaccines are the answer, don't realize they are actually for herd immunity. They don't realize vaccines are not harmless,either. @AlexBerenson Can you try to make these results available?",0

1471,"*Can I catch COVID-19 from feces, animals, pets, surfaces or packages?*

üöΩ *Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?*

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.","While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. 

üêæ *Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?*
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products. üê∂ *Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?*
There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.",0

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.","1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.

Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ 4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support. 5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water. 8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. 10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.",0

1533,"Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.","HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?

ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

üí¶ The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. ü•Ñ These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 

üëà Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

‚ÜîÔ∏è People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

1564,"Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?
Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. https://t.co/h8kjFn9QfU","Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/7jK6SA3bkC Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?
No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/eV03fM0bNT Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans. https://t.co/8kv46hjSYh Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/HN7yBWhYlQ Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/X63kY0i8o3 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?
No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.
However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Can humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?
Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified. What are the symptoms of someone infected with a coronavirus?
It depends on the virus, but common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.",0

You haven't shown at all how private entities regulated by other private entities would ensure testing accuracy and reliability so that they can be used to deal with a pandemic. You've deflected an awful lot, though. @dankyankees @Jayson588 @Chetclark21 @WithRaccoon @mdb2 @eshaLegal I reject your burden of proof. If I put in the work you will only move the goalposts and use false equivalencies. I do not think you are having this conversation in good faith. You have not even been able to answer a very specific use case for your alt hypothesis. Take care. @dankyankees @Jayson588 @Chetclark21 @WithRaccoon @mdb2 @eshaLegal 1/2 Yes, the specific use case of #COVID19 tests that are sensitive and reliable, which are both preconditions to being medically useful. The current FDA processes for proving test function are adequate. @dankyankees @Jayson588 @Chetclark21 @WithRaccoon @mdb2 @eshaLegal 2/2 While the bureaucracy itself could have moved faster in this specific crisis, that failure does not invalidate the utility and need for functional standards &amp; enforcement. You are arguing against this, therefore burden of proof lies with you. Has not been met at all. @dankyankees @Jayson588 @Chetclark21 @WithRaccoon @mdb2 @eshaLegal You should actually read that FDA release. It isn't doing what you seem to think it is. Burdens of proof within EUAs still required, CLIA still required. Devolving central regulatory authority to state-level regulatory authority is also included. Regulations not suspended.",0

Herd immunity may therefore kick in much sooner in the US.,"@anilvohra69 Agreed we are probably some ways off.  But then again, no one knows how much cross-immunity different populations may have.

 B. Weight and height 
 C. Medical history 
 D. Prescriptions 
 E. Their normal vital signs including 
 F. Copy of IDs and insurance docs You will need those details in case medical practitioners come/call when the illness begins. 

2. Once it does, take a note of the ff.:
 A. Dates, symptoms, vital signs every 6 hours 
 B. Hours the doctor called and their advice 
 C. The interventions you/the doctor made and time 3. Always wash your hands before and after contact of the patient 
4. Keep windows open 
5. Tell the patient to spend time outside under sunshine, but without making physical contact with others 
6. Change beddings every 24 hours 
7. Take showers and change clothes twice a day 8. Drink water regularly. The color of the urine should be light. Dark means dehydration. 
9. Take multivitamins every day

There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.","covid-19 myths vs truth https://t.co/QmasHPlOlL 5G DOESN‚ÄôT spread COVID-19

Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.

COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.

Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous

Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates

From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials Taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus
Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower.

1605,"Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.","Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. 

People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask. Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?‚Äù","@EvrytngElszTakn @DrJulienArbor @CBCAlerts Similar info on Health Canada website
https://t.co/CEYOuTmTha @EvrytngElszTakn @DrJulienArbor @CBCAlerts People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. @EvrytngElszTakn @DrJulienArbor @CBCAlerts Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. @EvrytngElszTakn @DrJulienArbor @CBCAlerts This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease
Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your","bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
#OpenParlyZW","Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching #COVID19 .Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.  #OpenParlyZW Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new #coronavirus ?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.
#OpenParlyZW Hand dryers are not effective in killing #COVID19 . To protect yourself against the new #coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. #OpenParlyZW However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever #OpenParlyZW Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new #coronavirus. #OpenParlyZW Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). #OpenParlyZW Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations #OpenParlyZW Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
#OpenParlyZW Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new #coronavirus #OpenParlyZW However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care #OpenParlyZW",0

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.

It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have++ diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.",0

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

1709,"What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?
- Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.","Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets. - Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
- Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. https://t.co/KlV6s5lbvH",0

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19 These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. T from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.... 9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread? 11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. 12. 
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone!

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. 13.(A)
However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: 13.(B)
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 13. (C)
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. 13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.",0

People with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to wear a medical mask. WHO (World Health Organization) advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks. #Tuskegee_RYS20 Can I catch COVID-19 from my pets? 

#Tuskegee_RYS20 https://t.co/KOc2aeqMu8 Is it safe to recieve a package from where the virus has been reported? 

Yes. The chance of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching it from a package that travelled, and exposed to diff. conditions and temps is also low #Tuskegee_RYS20 https://t.co/KVIxII2MDd Is there anything I SHOULDNT DO?

1852,"Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 

1/2","What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 

2/3 Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

3/3 How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

1/3 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 

2/3 People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

3/3 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

 ""Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?*
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air."" https://t.co/DvdJg5MO6r","@karunanundy Good info. Thanks. @karunanundy Saw this morning: https://t.co/rfpHTuKaHS The above info is from the WHO whatsapp link below, a few minutes ago. This too though, on March 16:

https://t.co/mWKUMLKZS3 @karunanundy What if droplets from an infected persons sneeze are floating in the air?

The problem here is because this is a new virus, there are  many contradictory messages floating around. Like, those without symptoms need not wear a mask. But, many infected persons dont have symptoms. ""The everyday person shouldn‚Äôt be concerned, Van Kerkhove said, but medical staff may be susceptible when performing procedures such as intubation ‚Äî where a tube is placed down a patient‚Äôs throat and into their airway to assist with breathing."" @karunanundy NeJM https://t.co/DPE0B6FElU @karunanundy yes it is the official advise that i was questioning. however on reading this very comprehensive article i just found on the issue, i think it is indeed sound
https://t.co/jMCLY9XbKE @karunanundy and this is the study btw which i was referring to(from the same article). i first heard about it from Reuters https://t.co/ppYLqIxzVw @karunanundy Covid-19 is mRNA virus disease and quite similar to SARS virus. Apart from respiratory droplets infections, this virus has got other high infectious properties.
