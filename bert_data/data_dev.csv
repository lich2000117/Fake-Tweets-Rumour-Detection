2,"How does COVID-19 spread? 

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.","I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.

It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A. What is a coronavirus? 
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS.
The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19. Should I worry about COVID-19? 

Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. 

It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new #coronavirus #OpenParlyZW","#COVID19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates From the evidence so far, the virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new #coronavirus ?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.
#OpenParlyZW Hand dryers are not effective in killing #COVID19 . To protect yourself against the new #coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. #OpenParlyZW However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever #OpenParlyZW Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new #coronavirus. #OpenParlyZW Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). #OpenParlyZW Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations #OpenParlyZW Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
#OpenParlyZW Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
#OpenParlyZW However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care #OpenParlyZW",0

#COVID19Lagos Myth: Antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating the new #coronavirus.
Fact: Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

Fact: It's always smart to stay well hydrated, whether you're sick or not. But, according to WHO, there's no evidence that drinking water can protect you from getting #covid19. Neither will gargling with salt water. Myth: 5G caused COVID-19
Fact: 5G is not responsible for causing the coronavirus. Coronaviruses have been around for decades, long before the advent of the wireless networks we have today. Neither is there any documented link between cellphones, including 5G phones, and cancer. RT to #FightCOVID19

102,"WHAT IS COVID-19?
The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome.

WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19? 
Cough or Sneeze
Shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing 
Fever 
Muscle pain","HOW IS COVID-19 SPREAD?
Droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes 
There are two routes by which people could become infected:
Secretions can be directly transferred into the mouths or noses of people who are nearby (within 2 metres) or could be inhaled into the lungs 
It is also possible that someone may become infected by touching a surface or object that has been contaminated with respiratory secretions (such as touching a doorknob or shaking hands with an infected) and then touching their own mouth, nose. HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19? 
Wash your hands frequently with soap under running water or use alcohol-based sanitizer if water is not available. 
Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing.",0

121,"Remember: 

Seasonal flu is *very different* to pandemic flu.

If someone says ""Covid-19 is just like the flu"", check which one they're talking about.

If they mean ""seasonal flu"", take what they say with a bucketload of salt.","As the name implies, seasonal flu goes round the world every year. We have high rates of immunity to it because many of us have been exposed before, and we even have vaccines to prevent it.

Pandemic flu happens just a few times in every century and is much more alarming. 1918 Spanish flu: One of the worst pandemics in history, killed up to 50 million people

1957 Asian flu: Killed at least a million

1968 Hong Kong flu: Killed at least a million

1977 Russian flu: Less than a million deaths

2009 swine flu: Killed several hundred thousand One of those five pandemics, the Russian flu, appears to have been just an old defrosted flu strain from a laboratory. People alive in the 1950s were immune, and the virus was weirdly similar to earlier ones. So really we're down to four truly novel pandemics. Anyone reading this has almost certainly lived through a pandemic, the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, but we were lucky there that it was extremely mild with a fatality rate not much different to seasonal flu. Fatality rates often fall as an epidemic spreads but it would be unwise to assume that case fatality in every pandemic will fall to swine flu levels. All the evidence so far suggests Covid-19 mortality is higher, by at least an order of magnitude.
 https://t.co/Pthp3Dwafs So don't panic but please don't be complacent.

Lots of tech/finance types are still talking about this as if it's no big deal.

Virologists and epidemiologists are taking it far more seriously.
 https://t.co/DK3joYkZwE @davidfickling Hoy did all those pandemic go away? @gustavobeltran Herd immunity gradually built up to the point it wasn't able to spread easily, and under this selective pressure the virus evolved to different and less fatal strains @davidfickling D",1

@TeamForPakistan Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”

(She's halfway there.) @CNN Not what she is claiming @CNN Well, she's a very lucky person to have met him. @Badass_Abe @CNN exactly.  She should follow the Patriots mantra, ""Do your job"". @CNN  yes just like people do for imagrents. @CNN 😒 @CNN you support or you don't, sorry, too many on the fence, it broke. @CNN #KimDavis should have kept this meeting private bet that's what Pope wanted shes using it to glorify/publicize herself more #Shameless @CNN popeturd is back tracking already... The PC police flexing their muscle again... Disgusting; and people still worship this false idol. @Lindzsy @CNN she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position. its a small town so go figure #KanyeShrug @CNN ask POTUS why does Chicago his home town has very strict gun laws &amp; very high gun violence? @GMA @MSNBC @CBSNews @NewDay @NBCNews @CNN don't tell me that the Vatican us telling a lie @CNN The Vatican is has given in. SMH. #KimDavis has More guts and stronger in her faith Than the Vatican and it Pope. @CNN @TheDeemeister too late! What other reason would the Pope have for a private meeting (she's not even Catholic) @Badass_Abe @CNN He is a holy man giving comfort. @CNN Most assuredly not! Ms. Davis has a true commitment to God and His Word. The Pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and $$. @CNN the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind, find a solution to Oregon like issues @CNN then how should we consider it? A show of...??? @CNN why are either of these idiots getting any coverage @CNN A church desperate to look cool is a sad thing @CNN She just needs to go away @CNN I'll believe that when #PopeFrancis meets with leaders of the #lgbt community The #Pope sent a clear message by meeting with #KimDavis @CNN then what should it be considered? Unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. #getreal @CNN So what is it? With God there is no sitting on the wall @CNN Too late for this... @CNN Of course it's a form of support! It just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies.  He supported the death row inmate too @CNN With that meeting, the Pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was. @CNN Then exactly how should the meeting be considered? @Pontifex shouldn't have met with #KimDavis to begin with. Rewarded bad behavior. @CNN Pope Francis may have spoke against Jesus Christ but he is not stupid enough to take a STAND on NONSENSE by the Kentucky Clerk @CNN I bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do I really have to talk to her @CNN Funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be... @CNN why the hell not @CNN Simply stop talking about her @hndavis12 @CNN 1 of the great things about this pope is he doesn't care about appearances. Maybe he was modeling peace &amp; forgiveness @CNN but what I heard on news..it seems it was a form of support..it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b.s @CNN her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up - those supporters keeping it in the news @CNN What is it then? Does Catholic church support homosexuality? Does it conduct gay marriages? @CNN so if all the military and police who protected him on his US  visit refused to do their job  based on religious beliefs is that ok? @CNN then he shouldn't have met with her!! @CNN #surelookslikeit @CNN thank GOD @CNN all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth @CNN The face of mental illness being made famous. @CNN Who ya gonna believe - me or the pope? They lyin! #gaykentucky #refreekimdavis @CNN hope he gave her a WTF about being divorced 3 times. @CNN @BjdelongBj.  Nor forgiveness... @CNN @LisaToddSutton Why would he meet with her anyway? You lost me, off my list! @HenryMgonzales It is perplexing, read an article yesterday, that said Pope was unaware, something to do with vatican politics. @CNN @CNN that's right people! Somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging! That's a sin! #crazylady @CNN ~ did he spank her ? @CNN well thank God she met the Pop though it's Sad the Vatican knows what the Bible says n still don't provide support for Kim! Sad sad! @CNN 1)Kim Davies is1 of d most courageous human I know.ALONE,she stood PUBLICALLY to defend God's guide for Mankind's progress&amp;evolution. @CNN Millions of Catholics wait a Lifetime to share a moment with a Pope.Why Her?Because the Pope is a Socialist who knows Propaganda! @CNN #PopeFrancis is a bullshitter @CNN @DevinGoldenberg Maybe not but the Pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from France to the Vatican.Says much @CNN Many people ""meet"" with a Pope. Apparently this was a blessing in DC. He probably never heard of her then Wham! He's in a storm. @CNN So what was it then?
Trying to help the sinner stop homophobing?
A strategy session?
Swapping culture war stories?
An affair? @CNN it's definitely support. But the Pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse. So who really cares. With how many of God's gay children did @Pontifex meet? In secret or public? Whether supportive or not? @CNN @CNN @Pontifex so I assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage? @CNN important point is that he met with her and not gay groups. Gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage. @BevDiane @southern_bel Terrible to follow Catholic doctrine by a pope, seriously ? @CNN Kim Davis makes my skin crawl! @CNN @Clarknt67 Read the rest of the sentence, not support for ALL of what she is doing. They qualified it. Meaning they support some of it @C_keroftruth101 takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be @CNN Doesn't matter why or what was said. She will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia. Just like they do with abortion issue @CNN @CodyDorumsgaard ((saw your status on Facebook the other day)) @CNN Pope met w/her in support of her religious liberty &amp; conscience to put God's law above constitution, which he made clear his position. @CNN https://t.co/Q5tM17kho6 buy this album if you love the pope @iShakeTheThrone @Pontifex @CNN he met with a gay couple the day before Kim Davis @CNN He too (#Pope) will stand before God. But won't be left standing. Repent of thy ways &amp; turn to God &amp; His Ways. #KimDavis -be encouraged @CNN That is a lie and the Vatican didn't say that.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).","What is a novel coronavirus?
A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Can humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?
Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified. What are the symptoms of someone infected with a coronavirus?
It depends on the virus, but common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.",0

175,"Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.","HOW LIKELY AM I TO CATCH THE COVID 19 However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at d early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research The risk depends on where you  are - and more ,whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. There is daily updates on the situation",0

$3.65 rural charge

Charge for same service by USPS? 

$0.50 or 31 times cheaper 

Save the USPS @kloss_tiffany @samwilkinson @lildipshit3 @anarchomastia Explain the justice of city folks subsidizing rural folks. Why shouldn't the price of postage reflect the actual costs of delivery?
By the way, rural per capita pollution is higher that urban per capita pollution @NathanaelDSnow @kloss_tiffany @samwilkinson @lildipshit3 @anarchomastia cities are less safe than rural areas. therefore, slightly more expensive. fedex/ups won't deliver to some areas in cities either, like gated communities, apartments w/ coded entries, etc. usps delivers there, and usps drivers even get keys to apt boxes that fedex/ups don't. ez. @stancija @kloss_tiffany @samwilkinson @anarchomastia I'm not sure about ""less safe.""
The option is not USPS, FedEx, UPS, or nothing; other delivery services could emerge.
Also, let the USPS charge more for ""dangerous delivery"" areas.

212,"Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.","Q. What is a CoronaVirus?
A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. 
#coronavirus #coronavirusindia Q. What is COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. [2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia Q. How does COVID-19 spreads?
A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates [2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus [3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia [2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia",0
213,"Q. How likely am I to catch COVID-19?
A. The risk depends on where you live or where you have travelled recently. The risk of infection is higher in areas where a number people have been diagnosed with COVID-19. #coronavirusindia","Q. Should I worry about COVID-19?
A.[1/3] If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low. [2/3] Look out information from your national public health authority for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area.  It is important to be informed of the situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. [3/3] If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice issued by national and local health authorities.  #CoronaVirusUpdates #coronavirusindia #CoronavirusReachesDelhi",0

We've been told that social distancing is what was needed. If these studies are true, then we'd need much more isolation.

Fingers crossed. @DrDenaGrayson It would also make the use of masks mandatory for everyone, BTW which is something the CDC has been very reluctant to propose. 

The question I have is why COVID-19 is less transmissible than Measles if it is actually an airborne transmitted disease? @fmbutt The size of respiratory particles for #coronavirus is thought to be larger than for measles, so it was thought to spread less readily. This latest research suggests that these prior assumptions are NOT correct and that #COVID19 can spread MUCH more easily than previous guidance. @maryjanecrisp @DrDenaGrayson @fmbutt I thought that article was pretty clear, but here's another one just in case.

Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. https://t.co/kSdfGWv5GI Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?
No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. https://t.co/sJhxDjdhrA Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?
Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?
No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?
No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6 Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials","covid-19 myths vs truth https://t.co/QmasHPlOlL 5G DOESN’T spread COVID-19

Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.

COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.

Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous

Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus. Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.

There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus
Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.

So why do we need it reiterated with this played out stereotype?

It just doesn't quite fit.","I hesitate to say there's such a thing as a perfect film, but having just watched Parasite for the first time, it hits pretty damn fucking close. I'm genuinely trying to think of things that bugged me. The one that struck me the most was how, yet again, we have a thriller type film like Us where we have to include Native Americans somehow. It's beyond played out at this point &amp; I wish they'd gone with something else. Bong Joon-ho clearly trusts his audience. Having just seen Train to Busan last year, his development from even then to now is clear. He doesn't bother with excess. And Parasite is so well trimmed.

But here we have just a little fat, a chewy piece on an otherwise perfect steak. And what would've made the film even closer to perfect was if some people who saw it weren't alienated by his inclusion of that trope.

I remember the discourse. Stuff like that hurts folk. I remember it with Us too.

And that's really the only thing bad about Parasite. It rightfully joins the ranks of Annihilation, Mad Max: Fury Road, No Country For Old Men, Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, There Will Be Blood, and Us as ""Films Riley Will Keep Thinking About For Years.""

It's deserving. They all are almost perfect. And I really will keep thinking. @RileyGryc i think that's part of the intent, but also it's to show how Western values have been forced into Korean society. the rich family identifies with Americans and blindly reproduces the harm the US has caused.

should be clear, i don't think that excuses it, you're right that it's @RileyGryc a tired and harmful depiction, but i think even if it could have been handled a lot better it was going for something deeper than just reinforcing how they're out of touch. @Insalubrity I've wanted to see that one but I hear it has ghosts. @RileyGryc They are obsessed with American culture and the way that comes out is the son obsessed with cowboys and Indians from our Westerns.

#LetsFightCorona @MenPk1
@TeamForPakistan These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 
#LetsFightCorona @MenPk1
@TeamForPakistan This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

@TeamForPakistan Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”

The other option is to take a deep breath, live in reality, and see the politics at work here @Jim96901501 @BuckSexton Numbers are not in line with increased testing though. So just to say “numbers are up because of increased testing” is incorrect. If cases are up 80% but testing is up 10% then testing doesn’t account for it. @Jim96901501 @BuckSexton They’re being ignored.

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. (1/3) https://t.co/rJzAEDFcVR","These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. (2/3) People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. (3/3)

315,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?","What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. https://t.co/LM6wHFpLd9 Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++ diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

317,"4. COVID-19 is just like the flu
SARS-CoV-2 definitely has flu like symptoms- aches, fever, and cough. both COVID-19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia. However, COVID-19 is more dangerous with  with a mortality rate between 1% and 3%,10-50 times greater than the seasonal flu","2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk
SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected. 6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus
Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus

https://t.co/speJA9BUHu 8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus
Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold
All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans. 5. Everyone with COVID-19 dies
This statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. In fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization 7. Face masks protect against coronavirus
Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.
https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa 9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans. 14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus
Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons
COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with. 10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus
Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses. 15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19
As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.

Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus.","covid-19 myths vs truth https://t.co/QmasHPlOlL 5G DOESN’T spread COVID-19

Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.

COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.

Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates

From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.

There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. Taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus
Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.

To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.  The coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets.",0

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”","Part 5

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

#FREDIBOAT Part 10

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, 
#FREDIBOAT Part 11

many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  
#FREDIBOAT Part 12

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    
#FREDIBOAT Part 13

Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this

route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

We'll have to wait their decision on this. ^AL @Shawhelp Who is “they”? Who’s decision are we waiting for? The league has already officially said the regular season is finished. That’s all CI is good for. Regular season finishes, centre ice finishes. I pay Shaw for a service, I didn’t receive the service.

Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. 

It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.","I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.

It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

Not Sun Tzu’s version, rather the Grand Old Duke of York’s version. @hector_drummond If only they’d called it organic community based Immunity. @hector_drummond Back at the beginning the CSO said elimination was impossible &amp; herd immunity, while not the policy, was the enviable end result unless we found a vaccine.

Labour &amp; the media would go nuts if herd immunity is back. @SidneyPArthurs1 @hector_drummond Immunity for the many not the few! @hector_drummond After October, when millions join the dole queue, taxes skyrocket, we plunge into a devastating recession and the suicide rate soars, lockdown will look indefensible and social distancing will be ignored by all but a minority of fannies.

Flu effects up to 1 billion people a year - rather more than this. @hector_drummond @Wokeman8 C19 is but a smokescreen.

It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. @Investacus @__sammy_r WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.

368,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people it can take even longer for symptoms to appear.

Symptoms can include:

●Fever
●Cough
●Trouble breathing
●Feeling tired
●Muscle aches","Most people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death. This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems. Should I see a doctor or nurse?

If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call your doctor or nurse. You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days ●You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website: https://t.co/TZfMwQbXwt. The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people. If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go. If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person. If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead. This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others. The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people. Will I need tests?

Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have COVID-19, they test samples of fluid taken from inside your nose and mouth. They might also do tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up, as well as your urine and stool (bowel movements). Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. They will also ask questions about any recent travel and whether you have been around anyone who might be sick. Your doctor might also order a chest X-ray to check your lungs. How is COVID-19 treated?

Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the ""ICU""). There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions, and make you as comfortable as possible. You might need extra oxygen to help you breathe easily. If you are having a very hard time breathing, you might need to be put on a ventilator. This is a machine to help you breathe. Can COVID-19 be prevented?

There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19:

●Wash your hands with soap and water often.
●Avoid touching your face with your hands.
●Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection. ●Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person, you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:

●Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible. ●Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19.
Experts do not recommend wearing a face mask if you are not sick, unless you are caring for someone who has (or might have) COVID-19. ●Clean often – It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, and bathroom surfaces.
●Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water often ●Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any body fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away. There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area. If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time. How can I prepare for a possible COVID-19 outbreak?

It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick. If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk, try not to panic. This way you will be able to receive and share information easily. Where can I go to learn more?

As we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself.",0

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.","Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX @ItsNotPersonal0 Now looked at the marked area and read my tweet again. https://t.co/xbMYB0t4mA Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?
No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.
However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. 

WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

391,"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? 

No. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. 

SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.","What is COVID-19? 

COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? 

No. 
Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. 

COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? 

Not yet. 
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.

However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. 

People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

The mask can only be used once.
If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask. Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet? 

No. 

There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Is there anything I should not do? 

The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

1. Smoking

2. Taking traditional herbal remedies 

3. Wearing multiple masks 

4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.

393,"What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to","more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19 What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets How does COVID-19 spread?
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. T from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.",0

399,"8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus
Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself","Thread about some popular myths on corona virus

1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body
Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin

These cannot kill viruses within the body!! 6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus
Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus

https://t.co/speJA9BUHu 9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold
All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans. 7. Face masks protect against coronavirus
Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.
https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa 9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans. 14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus
Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons
COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with. 10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus
Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses. 15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19
As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.

Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
#FightCOVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #COVID19NIGERIA #COVID19 #StayAtHomeChallenge Myth: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent infection with the new #coronavirus.
Fact:There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from Covid19. Regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. Myth: Eating garlic can prevent infection with the new #coronavirus
Fact: Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.
#COVID19Lagos Myth: Antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating the new #coronavirus.
Fact: Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. #COVID19NIGERIA #CoronaVirusInNigeria #CoronaVirusNigeria #StayAtHomeChallenge #StopTheSpread #Chloroquine Myth: If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you don't have a coronavirus infection.
Fact: While it's possible for the coronavirus to cause fibrosis, holding your breath is not a suitable at-home ""test"" to determine if you have lung damage... To get a proper diagnosis, you'd need a variety of tests performed by your doctor. And, if you're having difficulty breathing, from coronavirus or anything else, you should call your healthcare provider.

Fact: 5G is not responsible for causing the coronavirus. Coronaviruses have been around for decades, long before the advent of the wireless networks we have today. Neither is there any documented link between cellphones, including 5G phones, and cancer. RT to #FightCOVID19

437,"So what is Sweden pursuing, exactly? The strategy rests on a few pillars. 
1) lockdowns are wrong 
2) you are delaying deaths into the future 
3) we are building herd immunity 
4) we can spread the virus safely 

Debunked, one by one","And that's why they have always been strong opponents of lockdowns: Tegnell repeatedly said there was no evidence they would work. I mean, what have the lockdowns ever done for us? https://t.co/MB1qf5eoQ3 And to be fair, in theory it would have been an interesting question to explore back in March: are we sure they help? But we did not have a EU-sized laboratory nor the time to get data in. We had to act first. All we had is a control group, Sweden, which did not do very well 1) As the BBC article demonstrates, lockdowns greatly reduced the number of new cases in many countries. They saved lives, they bought us time, they contained potential superspreader events, and more 2) If you read the news in Sweden, in March they kept repeating that all the countries that went into lockdown will face a tragic second wave, hence we were doing the right thing by carefully spreading the virus now. Let's put it that statement to test, shall we? Denmark and Norway and Finland lifted their restrictions about the same days, let's use May 11th (DK and NO) as the ref. One month ago. How many more deaths have occurred in Scandinavia since our neighbors exited lockdowns? 
SW  1493 
DK      74 
FI        57
NO     22 https://t.co/yV6lZe1WLA 3) But we are smart, we are building herd immunity! 
[Side note: the argument is so morally repugnant I won't even begin to unpack it, as it reeks of social darwinism, but let's try and keep it aside, albeit difficult to keep aside. Anyhow let's go ahead] Herd immunity my a$$. You should never allow a bunch of people who suck at math take a ""calculated risk"". It is spreading slower than much more painfully than thought before  https://t.co/OvxXq33jmZ Coda: and it's not only the snapshot of today/ this week, it's the direction that is worrisome. Today Italy has found 202 new positive cases, Sweden (1/6th of the population) 776 Data as we stand today 

New cases 
🇮🇹 202 
🇸🇪776 

New deaths 
🇮🇹 71 
🇸🇪67

Currently in ICU 
🇮🇹 249 
🇸🇪283 

Sweden has 1/6 of the population However, direction is important too. Sweden is nowhere near limiting the spread (because, surprise, it has no intention to). *Partly* because we finally started testing more, but largely because we have a lot of infections, numbers are going up, not down https://t.co/KZH2Vcun3e There is no bending the curve necessary in the fantasy land of the we-should-soon-become-immune people https://t.co/zX95Dp2gSf Now, both countries have a large CFR -mortality for every 100 people found positive. And to Sweden's credit they have finally started testing more (bravo!) But it's still high at 10% https://t.co/L1qn7ZbetV And our policy as it stands is *designed* to produce new infections in the range of 500-600 per day (even if you dismissed the lab in Stockholm as a statistical fluke). How come Swedes are accepting a magnitude of 20x the deaths of their nordic neighbors? Be still, my heart",0

441,"9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?","CORONA VIRUS.
Thread. 6. So, how does the disease spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 7. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 8. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. 10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. 12. 
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone!

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. 13.(A)
However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: 13.(B)
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 13. (C)
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. 13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.",0

451,"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.","Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",0

456,"5. Everyone with COVID-19 dies
This statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. In fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization","2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk
SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected. Thread about some popular myths on corona virus

1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body
Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin

These cannot kill viruses within the body!! 6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus
Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus

https://t.co/speJA9BUHu 8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus
Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold
All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans. 7. Face masks protect against coronavirus
Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.
https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa 9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans. 14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus
Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons
COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with. 10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus
Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses. 15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19
As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.

So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray. Shambho Mahadeva🙏 @avanya06604007 @PraneyD @Ateendriyo @DimpleAtra  @radvind @ganesh_kala59 @Iyerpatriot @lalitha_jr @Kalpesh_IR @tweets_tinku @DimpleAtra",1

🧪 *Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?*

While","*What are the treatment options for COVID-19 (including drugs, vaccines, therapies)?*

💊 *Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?*
No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

💉 *Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?*

Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.

509,@JenkinsSucks @RCaseyONeill @shelby_pastor @JudgeClayJ What do these 2 results mean? The PCR (6/11) test as POSITIVE means there are RNA fragments in the patient. Dallas counts this as a “new case” The IgG test (6/12) shows the patient is cured and now immune. The PCR can’t determine active vs. viral fragments!!! https://t.co/zMlsaTVe1U,"Our hospitalizations for COVID19 reached 400 patients today; the highest ever. Think of hospitalizations as the tip of the iceberg you see and know there are a lot more undiagnosed cases in the community. Go to https://t.co/uERysAqFAr or my pinned tweet for Dr recs to stay safe. @JudgeClayJ Those all COVID hospitalizations, or do they include other underlying conditions?  Serious question... @JenkinsSucks @RCaseyONeill @shelby_pastor @JudgeClayJ Note, it takes approximately 14 days to generate IgG, so you could not be positive for active virus/infection and positive for IgG. IgG is the result of your immunological success over the virus. @JenkinsSucks @RCaseyONeill @shelby_pastor @JudgeClayJ IgG shows the pt. is healed and immune. PCR is flawed b/c it being “positive” (6/11/20 test) does NOT mean they actively have live virus, as PCR tests for RNA fragments. But Dallas County cites this as a “new case”, even though she first was a “new case” over a month ago.",0

No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.","The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.

Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ 1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?

Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. 4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?

UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. 5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water. 6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. 8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable. 9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. 10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.",0

🧪 *Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?*","WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR COVID-19 (INCLUDING DRUGS, VACCINES, THERAPIES)?

💊 *Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?*
No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

💉 *Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?* Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. #WHO#Whatsapp",0

581,"Part 6

How does COVID-19 spread?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 

#FREDIBOAT","Part 5

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

#FREDIBOAT Part 7

These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 Part 8

who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    

#FREDIBOAT Part 9
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?” Part 10

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, 
#FREDIBOAT Part 11

many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  
#FREDIBOAT Part 12

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    
#FREDIBOAT Part 13

Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?

The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this 
#FREDIBOAT Part 14 

route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 15

Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating

#FREDIBOAT Part 16

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?

Protection measures for everyone

Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 17

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
#FREDIBOAT for the latest news.

Part 18
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with 
#FREDIBOAT Part 19

droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many 
#FREDIBOAT Part 20

surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
#FREDIBOAT Part 21
This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as Part 22

cold, flu and COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will 
#FREDIBOAT Part 23

have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#FREDIBOAT Part 24

Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? 
#FREDIBOAT Part 25

You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

**********

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading

Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for 
#FREDIBOAT Part 26

everyone)

Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or 
#FREDIBOAT Part 27

to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 
#FREDIBOAT Part 28
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.

#FREDIBOAT Part 29

How likely am I to catch COVID-19?

The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around Part 30

the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to Part 31

comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in 

#FREDIBOAT Part 32

China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

Now. @WHO U can wash your hands as much as you want but evidence indicates to the virus being transferable by aerosols. The Diamond Princess and a case in a Hong Kong flat suggest it is being transferred via the air, not just through droplets. People need to wear masks &amp; eyewear as well. @WHO In Iran, we need the urgent intervention of the World Health Organization to prevent disaster.  This government has no crisis management at all. https://t.co/VFpiG1gnLt @WHO What are you going to do to help the poor people of China and Iran, put some pressure on their politicians to be honest. Put pressure on every country to support the Chinese and Iranian people. Stop talking rubbish, do something. Call a pandemic. People, more important than money @WHO Is that it, I cannot believe you want more money to keep telling us that. @WHO The virus can be transferred thru droplets. It can be transmitted through aerosols, if you’re in the same room as some1 &amp; they are breathing the same air, you can get the virus (masks &amp; eyewear are key). It can be transmitted through urine &amp; faeces - don’t use public toilets. @WHO I am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across Europe. Strict checks should be in place at every large city for both departures and arrivals in order to mitigate the risk of virus carriers spreading the disease. @WHO I travelled from London to Milan and Paris to London the last few days. Milan, only arrival passengers are being monitored for the disease while Paris Gare du Nord has no measures in place whatsoever. What is being done to fight this global pandemic ? @WHO The world's outbreak began to explode. Did you see that? Do you really see that? How many people died in Iran?

4. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.","Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new kind that was discovered in 2019 and hasn't been previously identified in humans. https://t.co/6BNvWJUpCQ This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, and even death. https://t.co/52dGXGoGvX 5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

6. Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. https://t.co/XJHiFN7AxB Things that need more attention about COVID-19 :

1. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.

2. Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus. 5. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.

6. UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. 7. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have fever because of the new coronavirus infection. But, cannot detect people who are infected without fever.

8. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body won't kill viruses that have already entered your body. 9. Vaccines against pneumonia, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

10. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 11. Garlic may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.

12. People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 13. Antibiotics don't work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and antibiotics shouldn't be used as a means of prevention or treatment.

14. There is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Thanks for your nice attention.

608,"6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus
Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus

https://t.co/speJA9BUHu","2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk
SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected. Thread about some popular myths on corona virus

1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body
Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin

These cannot kill viruses within the body!! 8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus
Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold
All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans. 7. Face masks protect against coronavirus
Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter.
https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa 9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans. 14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus
Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons
COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with. 10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus
Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses. 15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19
As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.

People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).","However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?
No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.

No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.

💉 *Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?*","WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR COVID-19 (INCLUDING DRUGS, VACCINES, THERAPIES)?

💊 *Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?*
No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. 

🧪 *Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?* While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. #WHO#Whatsapp",0

631,"Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

Evidenced by the surge here at home you can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have had numerous cases.","Just as fast as the virus has spread so has the misinformation surrounding COVID - 19 which can be equally as harmful. In this thread you’ll find many of the popular theories debunked as outlined by the @WHO . 5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19

Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. 

COVID-19 is spread through respiratoatry droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.
To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. Black People Can Get Corona.

Data on race and the virus is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions, but disparate rates of sickness and death have emerged in some places.

COVID - 19 is infecting and killing black people in the US at disproportionately high rates. @nytimes",0
