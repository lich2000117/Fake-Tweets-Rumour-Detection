Sincere condolences and apologoies for this barbaric act inflicted on someone who seems totally innocent. @SCClemons @ACTED#Time to close the Islamic threat from within Europe.Muslims sit in 2sides of the fence.Condemn atrocities yet preach it. @SCClemons @mehdirhasan @ACTED UK Muslims in almost unanimous condemnation of killing of aid workers &amp; journalists, &amp; all innocent people @SCClemons @vausecnn @ACTED They are so cruel....evil possessed people. May GOD wrath fall upon them in no time! @SCClemons @Mathidiot @ACTED Heartbreaking. @SCClemons @ACTED 
Does the @CIA/ other western spy orgs use aid workers as agents?
An honest answer please.
If so they share blame equally @GreatHeretic Murdered David Haines was a aid worker and had been for the last 15 years. He was our colleague. He was a humanitarian. @SCClemons @ACTED Please #RT our campaign to show that #ISIS do not represent British Muslims #NotInMyName  http://t.co/J0sXl5dz4E",0
